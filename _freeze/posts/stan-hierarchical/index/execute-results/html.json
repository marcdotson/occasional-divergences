In short, you have beliefs about unobserved values (e.g., the impact of price on customer satisfaction) and you use data to update those beliefs. The barrier to using Bayesian inference in practice has never been this intuition -- it's been the required computation. There has been a great deal of progress on this front, with [Stan](https://mc-stan.org) arguably providing the best modern solution.\n\nStan is a probabilistic programming language that provides a general-purpose sampler using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. In other words, Stan automates the required computation (for many models), allowing you to conduct Bayesian inference by focusing solely on model building. This is especially powerful when it comes to utilizing the mainstay of Bayesian inference: hierarchical models.\n\nThe goal of this post is to provide a gentle introduction to building hierarchical models in Stan. We will be interfacing with Stan through R and will be adopting a [tidy approach](https://www.tidyverse.org) whenever appropriate. This post does not provide an introduction to Bayesian inference, including a complete Bayesian inference workflow, or the basics of using Stan. For that, I recommend Michael Betancourt's [case studies](https://betanalpha.github.io/writing/), Richard McElreath's [*Statistical Rethinking*](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/), and the [Stan User's Guide](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_23/stan-users-guide/index.html). Much of what follows is motivated by Michael and Richard's work as well as Ben Goodrich's [StanCon 2019](https://mc-stan.org/events/stancon2019Cambridge/) tutorial.\n\n## Simple flat regression\n\nBy way of introduction, let's start with a simple flat or non-hierarchical regression. In a Stan script, which [has native support in RStudio](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/10/16/rstudio-1-2-preview-stan/), we specify the three required blocks for a Stan model: `data`, `parameters`, and `model` (i.e., the prior and the likelihood or observation model).\n\n\n::: {.cell output.var='flat_regression'}\n\n```{.stan .cell-code}\n// Index value and observations.\ndata {\n  int<lower = 1> N;    // Number of observations.\n  vector[N] y;         // Vector of observations.\n}\n\n// Parameters.\nparameters {\n  real mu;             // Mean of the regression.\n  real<lower = 0> tau; // Variance of the regression.\n}\n\n// Regression.\nmodel {\n  // Priors.\n  mu ~ normal(0, 5);\n  tau ~ normal(0, 5);\n\n  // Likelihood.\n  y ~ normal(mu, tau);\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe'll save this Stan script as `flat_regression.stan`. Imagine this is a model of customer satisfaction where we have `N` individuals, a vector of satisfaction scores `y` with a single observation from each individual, and we are assuming that satisfaction `y` is distributed `normal`, with a single mean `mu` and variance `tau` to describe customer satisfaction in the population. Finally, our joint model is complete with `normal` priors on `mu` and `tau`, where `tau` is constrained to be positive in the `parameters` block.\n\nLike all Bayesian models, this model is generative, so we can also use Stan to generate data according to some assumed parameter values and then use the generated data to test the model, including demonstrating parameter recovery. To do this, we reorganize these three blocks into `data` (which now includes the assumed parameter values as data) and `generated quantities` blocks (which now includes the observations that will be generated).\n\n\n::: {.cell output.var='generate_flat_data'}\n\n```{.stan .cell-code}\n// Index and parameter values.\ndata {\n  int<lower = 1> N;    // Number of observations.\n  real mu;             // Mean of the regression.\n  real<lower = 0> tau; // Variance of the regression.\n}\n\n// Generate data according to the simple regression.\ngenerated quantities {\n  // Vector of observations.\n  vector[N] y;\n\n  // Generate data.\n  for (n in 1:N) {\n    y[n] = normal_rng(mu, tau);\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe'll save this Stan script as `generate_flat_data.stan`. The for loop over `y` in the `generated quantities` block emphasizes the strong assumption of this flat or non-hierarchical model that a single mean `mu` and variance `tau` describe customer satisfaction for the entire population. If this doesn't sit well with you, a hierarchical model will provide the cure. We'll get there shortly.\n\nIn an R script, let's load the necessary packages, allow Stan to use as many cores as we have available, allow for Stan to save compiled code, specify assumed parameter values, and generate data according to our simple flat regression by calling `generate_flat_data.stan`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load packages.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rstan)\nlibrary(bayesplot)\nlibrary(tidybayes)\n\n# Set Stan options.\noptions(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())\nrstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)\n\n# Specify data and parameter values.\nsim_values <- list(\n  N = 100, # Number of observations.\n  mu = 5,  # Mean of the regression.\n  tau = 1  # Variance of the regression.\n)\n\n# Generate data.\nsim_data <- stan(\n  file = here::here(\"Code\", \"generate_flat_data.stan\"),\n  data = sim_values,\n  iter = 1,\n  chains = 1,\n  seed = 42,\n  algorithm = \"Fixed_param\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n```\nSAMPLING FOR MODEL 'generate_flat_data' NOW (CHAIN 1).\nChain 1: Iteration: 1 / 1 [100%]  (Sampling)\nChain 1: \nChain 1:  Elapsed Time: 0 seconds (Warm-up)\nChain 1:                0.000127 seconds (Sampling)\nChain 1:                0.000127 seconds (Total)\nChain 1: \n```\n\nStan provides verbose output noting progress as well as any warnings. Everything looks fine here, so we can go ahead and extract our simulated data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Extract simulated data.\nsim_y <- extract(sim_data)$y\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo test our model, we simply specify the simulated data as a list of data to be used as an input, call the regression model `flat_regression.stan` from R, and Stan does all the heavy lifting for us.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Specify data.\ndata <- list(\n  N = length(sim_y),   # Number of observations.\n  y = as.vector(sim_y) # Vector of observations.\n)\n\n# Calibrate the model.\nfit <- stan(\n  file = here::here(\"Code\", \"flat_regression.stan\"),\n  data = data,\n  seed = 42\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n```\nSAMPLING FOR MODEL 'flat_regression' NOW (CHAIN 4).\nChain 4: Gradient evaluation took 1.2e-05 seconds\nChain 4: 1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 0.12 seconds.\nChain 4: Adjust your expectations accordingly!\nChain 4: \nChain 4: \nChain 4: Iteration:    1 / 2000 [  0%]  (Warmup)\nChain 4: Iteration:  200 / 2000 [ 10%]  (Warmup)\nChain 4: Iteration:  400 / 2000 [ 20%]  (Warmup)\nChain 4: Iteration:  600 / 2000 [ 30%]  (Warmup)\nChain 4: Iteration:  800 / 2000 [ 40%]  (Warmup)\nChain 4: Iteration: 1000 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Warmup)\nChain 4: Iteration: 1001 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Sampling)\nChain 4: Iteration: 1200 / 2000 [ 60%]  (Sampling)\nChain 4: Iteration: 1400 / 2000 [ 70%]  (Sampling)\nChain 4: Iteration: 1600 / 2000 [ 80%]  (Sampling)\nChain 4: Iteration: 1800 / 2000 [ 90%]  (Sampling)\nChain 4: Iteration: 2000 / 2000 [100%]  (Sampling)\nChain 4: \nChain 4:  Elapsed Time: 0.031208 seconds (Warm-up)\nChain 4:                0.024732 seconds (Sampling)\nChain 4:                0.05594 seconds (Total)\nChain 4: \n```\n\nStan takes the three required blocks in `flat_regression.stan` and creates a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler to produce draws from the posterior. The output tracks progress across many iterations (2000 by default) and chains (4 by default) along with any problems. Here we have printed the output for the fourth chain only and no problems have been identified. We can also check the trace plots.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Check trace plots.\nfit %>%\n  mcmc_trace(\n    pars = c(\"mu\", \"tau\"),\n    n_warmup = 500,\n    facet_args = list(nrow = 2, labeller = label_parsed)\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n![](Figures/flat_mcmc_trace.png){width=1000px}\n\nWe have good mixing and clear convergence across all chains for both of our model parameters.\n\nFinally, we can demonstrate parameter recovery by plotting the marginal posteriors for each of our parameters to confirm that the assumed parameter values used when generating data are within or near reasonable credible intervals.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Recover parameter values.\npar_values <- tibble(\n  .variable = c(\"mu\", \"tau\"),\n  values = c(sim_values$mu, sim_values$tau),\n)\n\nfit %>%\n  gather_draws(mu, tau) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = .value, y = .variable)) +\n  geom_halfeyeh(.width = .95) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = values), par_values, color = \"red\") +\n  facet_wrap(\n    ~ .variable,\n    nrow = 2,\n    scales = \"free\"\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n![](Figures/flat_marginals.png){width=1000px}\n\nThe assumed parameter values (in red) have been recovered by the model (they are in or nearly within a customary 95% credible interval)! In summary, we've specified a simple flat or non-hierarchical regression model in Stan, generated data according to that model, and used the generated data to demonstrate that the model is working as intended.\n\n## Simple hierarchical regression\n\nSo why use a hierarchical model (also known as a multilevel or nested multilevel model)? The most straightforward reason is that sinking feeling we have about the assumption that a single set of parameters will effectively describe the entire population. In terms of customer satisfaction, we know there is heterogeneity across consumers -- not everyone behaves or thinks the same. At the very least, we can think about satisfaction being different for different customer groups or segments.\n\nSo what does a simple hierarchical regression look like in Stan?\n\n\n::: {.cell output.var='hierarchical_regression_01'}\n\n```{.stan .cell-code}\n// Index values and observations.\ndata {\n  int<lower = 1> N;               // Number of observations.\n  int<lower = 1> K;               // Number of groups.\n  vector[N] y;                    // Vector of observations.\n  int<lower = 1, upper = K> g[N]; // Vector of group assignments.\n}\n\n// Parameters and hyperparameters.\nparameters {\n  real mu;                        // Mean of the population model.\n  real<lower = 0> tau;            // Variance of the population model.\n  vector[K] beta;                 // Vector of group intercepts.\n  real<lower = 0> sigma;          // Variance of the likelihood.\n}\n\n// Hierarchical regression.\nmodel {\n  // Hyperpriors.\n  mu ~ normal(0, 5);\n  tau ~ normal(0, 5);\n\n  // Prior.\n  sigma ~ normal(0, 5);\n\n  // Population model and likelihood.\n  beta ~ normal(mu, tau);\n  for (n in 1:N) {\n    y[n] ~ normal(beta[g[n]], sigma);\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn the `data` block, we now have a vector `g` indicating which one of `K` groups each of our `N` individuals belong to. In the `parameter` block, we now have a `K`-dimensional vector of `beta` parameters, a separate mean for each of the `K` groups. In the `model` block we can see that the likelihood (now within a for loop) is still assumed `normal`, but now each individual's observed overall satisfaction has a mean of `beta` specific to the group they belong to. We also have a population model `beta ~ normal(mu, tau)` that says these separate, group-level `beta` coefficients are themselves drawn from a population that is assumed `normal` with a mean `mu` and variance `tau`.\n\nThis is what is meant by a hierarchy: there are two levels to our model, the lower-level likelihood or observation model and the upper-level population model. Finally, our joint model is complete with a prior on the population model parameters (formally referred to as hyperpriors, since they are priors on a prior): `normal` hyperpriors on `mu` and `tau` (constrained to be positive). The likelihood variance, now called `sigma`, retains the same prior and positive constraint.\n\nWe can again translate this Stan script, `hierarchical_regression_01.stan`, into `data` and `generated quantities` blocks. Let's call this script `generate_hierarchical_data_01.stan` and use Stan to generate data for us.\n\n\n::: {.cell output.var='generate_hierarchical_data_01'}\n\n```{.stan .cell-code}\n// Index and hyperparameter values.\ndata {\n  int<lower = 1> N;               // Number of observations.\n  int<lower = 1> K;               // Number of groups.\n  int<lower = 1, upper = K> g[N]; // Vector of group assignments.\n  real mu;                        // Mean of the population model.\n  real<lower = 0> tau;            // Variance of the population model.\n  real<lower = 0> sigma;          // Variance of the likelihood.\n}\n\n// Generate data according to the hierarchical regression.\ngenerated quantities {\n  vector[N] y;                    // Vector of observations.\n  vector[K] beta;                 // Vector of group intercepts.\n\n  // Draw parameter values and generate data.\n  for (k in 1:K) {\n    beta[k] = normal_rng(mu, tau);\n  }\n  for (n in 1:N) {\n    y[n] = normal_rng(beta[g[n]], sigma);\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nNote that the `data` block now includes the assumed parameter values for the *hyperpriors* as data with `beta` being drawn alongside `y` in the `generated quantities` block. Let's call this Stan script from R to generate data according to a hierarchical model.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Specify data and hyperparameter values.\nsim_values <- list(\n  N = 500,                            # Number of observations.\n  K = 5,                              # Number of groups.\n  g = sample(5, 500, replace = TRUE), # Vector of group assignments.\n  mu = 5,                             # Mean of the population model.\n  tau = 1,                            # Variance of the population model.\n  sigma = 1                           # Variance of the likelihood.\n)\n\n# Generate data.\nsim_data <- stan(\n  file = here::here(\"Code\", \"generate_hierarchical_data_01.stan\"),\n  data = sim_values,\n  iter = 1,\n  chains = 1,\n  seed = 42,\n  algorithm = \"Fixed_param\"\n)\n\n# Extract simulated data and group intercepts.\nsim_y <- extract(sim_data)$y\nsim_beta <- extract(sim_data)$beta\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can test our simple hierarchical model using our new simulated data to fit the hierarchical regression from R.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Specify data.\ndata <- list(\n  N = length(sim_y),    # Number of observations.\n  K = sim_values$K,     # Number of groups.\n  y = as.vector(sim_y), # Vector of observations.\n  g = sim_values$g      # Vector of group assignments.\n)\n\n# Calibrate the model.\nfit <- stan(\n  file = here::here(\"Code\", \"hierarchical_regression_01.stan\"),\n  data = data,\n  seed = 42\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n```\nWarning messages:\n1: There were 6 divergent transitions after warmup. Increasing adapt_delta above 0.8 may help. See\nhttp://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#divergent-transitions-after-warmup \n2: Examine the pairs() plot to diagnose sampling problems\n```\n\nOur sampler has identified a problem. We only have a simple hierarchical model and already our unique Hamiltonian Monte Carlo diagnostic, a divergent transition or divergence, has identified an issue. There is a [good reason for these divergences](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0906). The short story is that hierarchical models have posteriors with geometry that is difficult to navigate. This is true independent of the sampler, but it's quickly evident when using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.\n\nTo address this issue, our first step (and one that is helpfully suggested in the warning message above) is to increase the `adapt_delta`, which functions like a step size as the sampler navigates the posterior. A larger `adapt_delta` equates to a smaller step size, meaning the sampler will be more careful as it navigates but it will also take longer. We find that `adapt_delta = 0.99` (it only goes to 1) results in no divergences.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calibrate the model.\nfit <- stan(\n  file = here::here(\"Code\", \"hierarchical_regression_01.stan\"),\n  data = data,\n  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99),\n  seed = 42\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can now check trace plots, this time for both the population hyperparameters and the group parameters.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Check trace plots.\nfit %>%\n  mcmc_trace(\n    pars = c(\"mu\", \"tau\", str_c(\"beta[\", 1:data$K, \"]\"), \"sigma\"),\n    n_warmup = 500,\n    facet_args = list(nrow = 5, labeller = label_parsed)\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n![](Figures/hierarchical_mcmc_trace-01.png){width=1000px}\n\nFinally, we can demonstrate parameter recovery for both the population-level hyperparameters and the group-level parameters.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Recover hyperparameter and parameter values.\nhyper_par_values <- tibble(\n  .variable = c(\"mu\", \"tau\", \"sigma\"),\n  values = c(sim_values$mu, sim_values$tau, sim_values$sigma),\n)\n\nbeta_values <- tibble(\n  n = 1:data$K,\n  beta = as.vector(sim_beta)\n)\n\nfit %>%\n  gather_draws(mu, tau, sigma) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = .value, y = .variable)) +\n  geom_halfeyeh(.width = .95) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = values), hyper_par_values, color = \"red\") +\n  facet_wrap(\n    ~ .variable,\n    nrow = 3,\n    scales = \"free\"\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n![](Figures/hierarchical_marginals-01a.png){width=1000px}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfit %>%\n  spread_draws(beta[n]) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = beta, y = n)) +\n  geom_halfeyeh(.width = .95) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = beta), beta_values, color = \"red\") +\n  facet_wrap(\n    ~ n,\n    nrow = 3,\n    scales = \"free\"\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n![](Figures/hierarchical_marginals-01b.png){width=1000px}\n\nBoth the assumed hyperparameter and parameter values have been recovered by the model! To summarize, we have now specified a simple hierarchical regression model in Stan, generated data according to that model, and used the generated data to demonstrate that the model is working.\n\n## Multiple hierarchical regression\n\nIn this final section, let's more fully embrace what it means to have a hierarchical model. With both a likelihood or observation model *and* a population model, we can include both observation-level and population-level covariates.\n\nExciting, right? Let's get started.\n\n\n::: {.cell output.var='hierarchical_regression_02'}\n\n```{.stan .cell-code}\n// Index values, observations, and covariates.\ndata {\n  int<lower = 1> N;               // Number of observations.\n  int<lower = 1> K;               // Number of groups.\n  int<lower = 1> I;               // Number of observation-level covariates.\n  int<lower = 1> J;               // Number of population-level covariates.\n\n  vector[N] y;                    // Vector of observations.\n  int<lower = 1, upper = K> g[N]; // Vector of group assignments.\n  matrix[N, I] X;                 // Matrix of observation-level covariates.\n  matrix[K, J] Z;                 // Matrix of population-level covariates.\n}\n\n// Parameters and hyperparameters.\nparameters {\n  matrix[J, I] Gamma;             // Matrix of population-level coefficients.\n  real<lower = 0> tau;            // Variance of the population model.\n  matrix[K, I] Beta;              // Matrix of observation-level coefficients.\n  real<lower = 0> sigma;          // Variance of the likelihood.\n}\n\n// Hierarchical regression.\nmodel {\n  // Hyperpriors.\n  for (j in 1:J) {\n    Gamma[j,] ~ normal(0, 5);\n  }\n  tau ~ normal(0, 5);\n\n  // Prior.\n  sigma ~ normal(0, 5);\n\n  // Population model and likelihood.\n  for (k in 1:K) {\n    Beta[k,] ~ normal(Z[k,] * Gamma, tau);\n  }\n  for (n in 1:N) {\n    y[n] ~ normal(X[n,] * Beta[g[n],]', sigma);\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn the `data` block, we now have an index `I` specifying the number of observation-level covariates and an index `J` specifying the number of population-level covariates along with a corresponding `N x I` matrix `X` that contains the observation-level covariates (including an intercept) and a `K x J` matrix `Z` that contains the population-level covariates (again, including an intercept).\n\nIn the `parameters` block, `Beta` is now a `K x I` matrix of coefficients rather than a vector and `Gamma`, a `J x I` matrix of population-level coefficients, takes the place of `mu`. The `model` block also changes accordingly, with the population model in a for loop and including `Z[k,] * Gamma` in place of `mu` and the likelihood including `X[n,] * Beta[g[n],]'` in place of `beta[g[n]]`. Note, however, that we are still assuming that the population model is distributed `normal` with a common variance `tau`. We'll come back to this at the end.\n\nWe can again translate this Stan script, `hierarchical_regression_02.stan`, into `data` and `generated quantities` blocks. Let's call this script `generate_hierarchical_data_02.stan` and use Stan to generate data for us.\n\n\n::: {.cell output.var='generate_hierarchical_data_02'}\n\n```{.stan .cell-code}\n// Index values, covariates, and hyperparameter values.\ndata {\n  int<lower = 1> N;               // Number of observations.\n  int<lower = 1> K;               // Number of groups.\n  int<lower = 1> I;               // Number of observation-level covariates.\n  int<lower = 1> J;               // Number of population-level covariates.\n\n  int<lower = 1, upper = K> g[N]; // Vector of group assignments.\n  matrix[N, I] X;                 // Matrix of observation-level covariates.\n  matrix[K, J] Z;                 // Matrix of population-level covariates.\n  real<lower = 0> tau;            // Variance of the population model.\n  real<lower = 0> sigma;          // Variance of the likelihood.\n}\n\n// Generate data according to the hierarchical regression.\ngenerated quantities {\n  vector[N] y;                    // Vector of observations.\n  matrix[J, I] Gamma;             // Matrix of population-level coefficients.\n  matrix[K, I] Beta;              // Matrix of group-level coefficients.\n\n  // Draw parameter values and generate data.\n  for (j in 1:J) {\n    for (i in 1:I) {\n      Gamma[j, i] = normal_rng(0, 5);\n    }\n  }\n  for (k in 1:K) {\n    for (i in 1:I) {\n      Beta[k, i] = normal_rng(Z[k,] * Gamma[,i], tau);\n    }\n  }\n  for (n in 1:N) {\n    y[n] = normal_rng(X[n,] * Beta[g[n],]', sigma);\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nNote that the `data` block now includes the `X` and `Z` matrices, the observation-level and population-level covariates, respectively. We could also generate these matrices, each of which includes an intercept as the first column, in the `generated quantities` block instead of generating them in R. Also note that in the `generated quantities` block we have an additional for loop for simulating `Beta` and `Gamma` since we are working with matrices of coefficients instead of vectors. Let's generate data by calling this Stan script from R.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Specify data and hyperparameter values.\nsim_values <- list(\n  N = 500,                            # Number of observations.\n  K = 5,                              # Number of groups.\n  I = 7,                              # Number of observation-level covariates.\n  J = 3,                              # Number of population-level covariates.\n\n  # Matrix of observation-level covariates.\n  X = cbind(\n    rep(1, 500),\n    matrix(runif(500 * (7 - 1), min = 1, max = 10), nrow = 500)\n  ),\n\n  # Matrix of population-level covariates.\n  Z = cbind(\n    rep(1, 5),\n    matrix(runif(5 * (3 - 1), min = 2, max = 5), nrow = 5)\n  ),\n\n  g = sample(5, 500, replace = TRUE), # Vector of group assignments.\n  tau = 1,                            # Variance of the population model.\n  sigma = 1                           # Variance of the likelihood.\n)\n\n# Generate data.\nsim_data <- stan(\n  file = here::here(\"Code\", \"generate_hierarchical_data_02.stan\"),\n  data = sim_values,\n  iter = 1,\n  chains = 1,\n  seed = 42,\n  algorithm = \"Fixed_param\"\n)\n\n# Extract simulated data and group intercepts.\nsim_y <- extract(sim_data)$y\nsim_Gamma <- extract(sim_data)$Gamma\nsim_Beta <- extract(sim_data)$Beta\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's fit the model and recover parameters.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Specify data.\ndata <- list(\n  N = sim_values$N,     # Number of observations.\n  K = sim_values$K,     # Number of groups.\n  I = sim_values$I,     # Number of observation-level covariates.\n  J = sim_values$J,     # Number of population-level covariates.\n  y = as.vector(sim_y), # Vector of observations.\n  g = sim_values$g,     # Vector of group assignments.\n  X = sim_values$X,     # Matrix of observation-level covariates.\n  Z = sim_values$Z      # Matrix of population-level covariates.\n)\n\n# Calibrate the model.\nfit <- stan(\n  file = here::here(\"Code\", \"hierarchical_regression_02.stan\"),\n  data = data,\n  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99),\n  seed = 42\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNote that even though we've preemptively set `adapt_delta = 0.99` given the previous model's performance, it will be easy to run into problems as we add more complexity to the posterior.

To summarize, we have now specified a multiple hierarchical regression model in Stan -- with covariates at both the observation and population levels -- generated data according to that model, and used the generated data to demonstrate that the model is working.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nWhile we haven't touched on a complete Bayesian inference workflow, including evaluating prior and likelihood specifications using prior and posterior predictive checks, hopefully this provides a helpful starting point for using hierarchical models in Stan.\n\nNote that we assumed throughout that the population model has a common variance. Relaxing this assumption requires that the population model be distributed multivariate normal with an accompanying covariance matrix, a far more flexible population model specification but one that adds enough complexity to the posterior geometry to [require a non-centered parameterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0906). We'll follow up on this topic in its own blog post.\n\nHierarchical models provide partial information pooling, a middle-ground between no information pooling (i.e., separate flat or non-hierarchical models for each group), which may not be possible, and complete information pooling (i.e., a single flat or non-hierarchical model), which provides limited inference. They also allow for covariates and parameter estimation at both the observation and population levels. To summarize, hierarchical models allow us to appropriately model heterogeneity -- differences across groups. Given the prevalence of heterogeneity, hierarchical models should be our default approach in most applications and Stan removes the barriers to entry for the required Bayesian computation.\n\n-----\n\n### Marc Dotson\n\nMarc is an assistant professor of marketing at the BYU Marriott School of Business.
