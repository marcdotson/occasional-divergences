  Most introductions to Python are written for new programmers. But if you already know another language, it's easier to learn Python using your known language as an analogy. This introduction to Python is written for R users.

In classes and workshops over many years, I've taught analytics using R. But in my new position, I teach analytics using Python. This introduction to Python is for R users---primarily me. Hopefully it proves useful to others as well.

There are incredible resources in this space, and I've drawn liberally from many of them. As an overall introduction to Python, [*Python for Data Analysis*](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) is a go-to resource and the spiritual equivalent of [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz). I also really appreciate the work in [*Python and R for the Modern Data Scientist*](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Modern-Data-Scientist-Worlds/dp/1492093408), especially for their clear espousing of the strengths and weaknesses of both languages. This isn't an either/or situation. I still use R even as I start to use Python.

Additional resources will be provided where relevant in each section.

## Mindset

R is:

- Specialized language
- Developed by statisticians
- Lazy about efficiency
- Lazy about namespacing
- Functional programming
- Small and medium data
- Data wrangling and visualization
- Spacing is for convenience
- Dominated by Posit
- R Markdown and Quarto
- Consistency in the tidyverse
- "R Users" and "Tidy" code

Python is:

- General language
- Developed by computer scientists
- Obsessed with efficiency
- Obsessed with namespacing
- Object-oriented programming
- Small, medium, and large data
- Machine learning and deep learning
- Spacing is part of the syntax
- No single authority
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Inconsistent (i.e., no tidyverse)
- "Pythonistas" and "Pythonic" code

## Installation and environments?

- pyenv and venv or pdm?
- VS Code or Posit's new code editor? Quarto as motivation.
- Reference my own reproducible environments post, but now just for Python.

## The (chosen) PyData stack

The Python data (i.e., PyData) stack refers to the ecosystem of packages that enables data analysis.

- NumPy is short for "Numerical Python." It includes arrays and efficient computation across arrays.
- pandas is short for "panel data." It is built on NumPy and adds data frames for tabular or "heterogeneous" data and is the most popular package for data wrangling.
- Polars is a newer package for data wrangling. It's name is an anagram of the query engine it uses (OLAP) and the language it's built in (Rust or rs).
- matplotlib provides a foundation for plotting.
- seaborn is built on matplotlib and integrates with pandas. seaborn.objects is a more consistent API based on grammar of graphics.
- scikit-learn is a machine learning library built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.

## Python basics?

- Code relies on white space not braces.
- Everything is an object, including imported modules (a module is a single file, while a package is a collection of modules in a directory).
- The assignment (or *binding*) operator is `=`.
- Attached functions called *methods* use the `.` notation following the object, `obj.some_method(x, y, z)`. Note that CmdStanR adopts this syntax. For example `model$sample()` in CmdStanR is `model.sample()` in CmdStanPy.
- Lists are the fundamental data class and are created with single square brackets.
- Objects aren't copied needlessly, they are just bound to the same underlying data structure.
- Many objects or *mutable*. Their contents can be changed.
- **Remember that Python is zero-indexed.**
- `NULL` is referred to as `None`. Other types include `str`, `bytes` (binary), `float`, `bool`, and `int`.

## Data wrangling

Polars. A Rust library with Python bindings. A query engine with a data frame API on top. Something of an answer to pandas problems. The backend is in Rust instead of NumPy. Built on chaining expressions inside contexts instead of working on Series. Good with small and medium data. Everything stored in Arrow formats, including improvements for storing strings. No row indices. Lazy instead of eager evaluation, including a benefit for chaining.

## Visualization

seaborn is a high-level interface to matplotlib. Originally focused on filling gaps in matplotlib’s feature set. Now it’s bringing some tidy philosophy to its plotting. Figure setups via matplotlib, plot function and parameters, axis parameters and decorations. Now seaborn.objects is more based on the underlying grammar of graphics. Start with a .Plot() and then add layers from the four families of methods: .Mark(), .Stat(), .Move(), .Scale().

## Modeling

scikitlearn, etc.

## Communication

In learning Python find something that provides real value quickly. This is the pitch for Shiny for Python. It has programmatic range with a consistent philosophy with reactivity. Streamlit is optimized for simple applications, like a parameterized Quarto document. Dash is built on stateless applications (i.e., independent components), like Shiny without reactive expressions where the different pieces can’t communicate. Django/Flask/FastAPI is great for large apps.

- Quarto or/and Jupyter Notebooks.

>One thing I love to share with them is that fast.ai is built:
>- entirely with Quarto
>- entirely out of .ipynb files
>
>`quarto convert` can be used to go back and forth between .ipynb and .qmd!
>
>Yes, that totally works. In addition, quarto render a-notebook.ipynb works out of the box, so you don't even need to convert
>It works both for notebooks that have been created in a different environment (and so can't be re-executed because the results are only possible to produce in, say, google colab), and for notebook that you want to re-execute at every rendering. (quarto render notebook.ipynb vs quarto render notebook.ipynb --execute) Our documentation has https://quarto.org/docs/tools/jupyter-lab.html.
>
>And if your folks really love the JupyterLab authoring experience, we have a JupyterLab extension that makes it a little easier to create ipynb files that work well with Quarto: https://quarto.org/docs/tools/jupyter-lab-extension.html.
>
>Is it possible to render an .ipynb using Quarto (after adding a yaml raw block) from a Jupyter Notebook? Or does it have to be within an IDE? I have colleagues who have used nbconvert to create pdfs via latex and they're wondering if it's possible to use Quarto's typst integration to go straight from .ipynb (not viewed in an IDE) to producing a pdf via typst. The workflow here is working in a Jupyter Notebook hosted on a Jupyter Hub.
>
>yes - that should be totally possible. quarto render nb.ipynb should just work.
