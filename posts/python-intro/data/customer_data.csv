They are a very generic (unisex) fit and absolutely unflattering. I realize sweat pants are not generally a fashion statement, but these sagged at the backside unless the waistband was pulled up to her chest. These went straight back to Amazon & we will be ordering a few more pairs of the Soffe Football capris. Much cuter & better fit for girls!"

I have to say, this bike seat holds up.

I received the version with a red and black color tone.  The black looks black and the red looks vibrant.  No complaints there.  It looks a lot better in person than it does in the photos provided on the product page.

The material of the seat feels well made.  Under, the main body is made completely out of metal.  It feels very sturdy.  On top, I believe the material to be real leather.  I can tell because the holes made in the material to fasten it on underneath the seat looks like genuine leather, not faux leather, otherwise known as pleather.  The material does not feel like it will ever rip.

Some people may wonder why the nose on this bike seat is so long, or why bike seats have noses at all.  This is because it is supposed to help control the bike.  When riding fast, riders may lift off the seat.  Without looking at the seat when sitting back down, the nose can help direct the rider towards the correct seating position.  It is also helpful when getting on the bike for the same reasons.

Riding with this bike seat, I never encountered any pain.  Initially though, I did have to get used to how thin the seat was.

I highly recommend this product.  It is well made and it serves its purpose well.

I have received this item at a reduced price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."

I wasn't sure which tension option to get, but I went with the blue and am happy.  It is the perfect amount of tension for me (woman, 37 years old).  I use it a few times a week and am noticing a difference.  I like being able to use it on individual fingers or all at once.  Also seems made well.  A man would probably want a bit more tension.  However, I have read that for hand strength, more reps at lower tension is better."

I was on a search for the largest capacity bottle that would fit the frame.  The non-insulated Podium bottles are the best non-insulated bottles I could find.  They share the ergonomic shape and excellent valve of the insulated bottles.  They have just the right amount of squeezability to get the water out without over squirting and the valve is amazing.  While being easy to drink from, it does not leak when overturned.  Furthermore you can lock out the valve for off-bike transport so that it will not leak even when accidentally squeezed.  The bottle also does not have a funny taste.

The 21 oz bottle is 8"" tall and the 24"" bottle is 9"" tall.  The 21 oz bottle fits the slant bottle cage well and just barely  fits the seat post cage.  The 24 oz bottle only fits the slant tube, and it is crowded.  You will need to check your own frame carefully.  For the bike in question, the 21 oz bottle is the best fit.  It is the largest volume bottle I could find that fits the frame and has all the great features described above.

If space is a consideration, I highly recommend these bottles.  If you have more open frame geometry, consider the insulated Podium Chill."

Easy to put on and easy to pull off i bought these in a size large and they fit perfect.
Like most people i have gone through a lot of mittens/gloves looking for that very special one that indeed does keep your hands warm.
I have found it in this Mitt.
What they say is true,mittens warm your hands better than gloves probably because all your fingers are touching instead of being separated.
These are made in China,pretty much like everything else is anymore but they do the job of keeping your hands warm.
While wearing these you can still handle a shovelful of snow without any problem.
They fit snug and they feel good,can't remember where i got mine i think through Ebay or a Catalog store.
Anyway having found these i won't be buying anymore gloves/mitts not unless these fall apart.
Not much chance of that happening these are very well made so i highly recommend these for the winter person out there or for anybody that has to deal with the COLD!
You also don't need liners or warmup packs with these."

Who wants to spend time washing all that stuff (including the unit itself) with freezing cold water in the woods??

It goes PRETTY far (I tested it) and is bright depending on the batteries, I suppose. I use this for my security work at the clubs. I can catch attention from a distance.

EDIT: The top is a struggle to turn now, and the light is dim. I don't know if I just need new batteries, but aside from that, the push button is harder to push in, to turn off, and it seems to be falling apart. I've had it about a year. Save your money."

Put it away after that and didn't use until last week for a basement camping, so about 4 months in storage.  It was fully-charged when we put it away.  It was completely dead when Inpulled it out.

The package arrived as stated from amazon. Have to admit, you can't beat Prime.

Everything was in the package, no damaged or missing pieces. Assembly took less than an hour. I didn't time myself, but the directions were easy to follow so it didn't take long. Although tools were provided on he box, I used my own tools so that helped speed it up even more. All the holes lined up and pieces fit together easily.

Once assembled, I tried out three basic exercises. I did pull ups, squats and bench press. I also did deadlift, but only used the lowest part of the rack to load the plates on the bar but did not need it for the actual exercise.

During pull ups, the rack moved a little bit, just a little sway but it felt secure enough.

During the squats and bench press, the bar catch was easy enough to adjust and held the bar at the right level to start each exercise. If I could have one complaint, it's the lack of a safety bar. I looked to see if I could find one as an accessory but have not found the right size yet. So know your limit or have a spotter for safety.

Overall, I'm satisfied with this Power Rack.

I gave this equipment 3 stars because it's only good. It's not the best equipment out there. You would have to spend a bit more money for gym quality."

The square format provides maximum coverage, and can be positioned in a diamond shape if that is your aesthetic choice. Simply piece together 3 of the puzzle-like sections, fit them around your board, and then attach the final piece. It hugs the circular board and there is no need to attach it to the wall. The 1"" thick foam should keep just about any throw reaching the wall.

This surround aesthetically goes well with GLD boards, and should fit any regulation size board. What keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the overly large Viper logo and the price of admission. To be fair, the one I received (photo) actually has a smaller white Viper logo on the left, and the Defender II logo at the top right. AND you can flip it if you don't want logos, or want to prolong the life of the protector after it has a ton of holes on the other side. The Defender II also costs more than my Viper Dead-On Sisal board. There are less expensive alternatives, but there is no denying the Defender II's quality.

Even if you are a pro and never miss the board, not everyone playing darts in your home may be so skilled. A protector is worthwhile insurance. You just have to decide if the price is worth it to you.

You then load the bullets into the chamber like a real revolver and can even spin the chamber realistically as well. It's fun to load, and the speed loader is a fun accessory but not necessary.  I suggest purchasing extra bullets so you are not BB's loading as often. I bought enough to load a gun belt. This is a great little varmint or snake gun to carry, especially in areas where a real firearm would be illegal or dangerous.  It uses CO2 cartridges, sold separately, so be sure to buy some. Considering the cost of BB's, extra mock bullets, CO'2 cartridges etc. needed for shooting it still is very inexpensive compared to shooting real ammunition, even small caliber like 22. I get approximately 50-60 shots from a cartridge powerful enough to penetrate aluminum cans before changing cartridges."

 First day of use, and i flicked my bike up and the pedal whipped around into my knee, and I only heard the slap and only felt the weight of the bike.

I bought these b/c I've 'slipped a pedal' before and its worse than getting kicked in the shins because your falling into it with all your own weight. These guards will disperse a good amount of force.. I hope I never find out, but I feel confident in them.

 They also insulate my legs from cold rain and keep the pants legs from getting greasy, or caught up in the chain.

I wish the latching system was clamps or had a larger levers because they're sometimes a pita to remove. Being fair, I didn't read the directions, so if there's a secret to removing them then lmk...but at least they lock in place.... I hope that snap-in (made of plastic) doesn't break. It is going to get a lot of use, since I don these (at least) ten times a week.

I'd also like to see them come in other colors, like camo and red, white and blue.

I've used them about 30 times....and the snap-ins are still a pita, but don't seem to be wearing out or breaking... they've taken a couple dings but nothing major yet and I really like wearing them every time I go out... I don't like wearing helmets but these are great.

keeps full mobility and I may use them for snowboarding too (since I run baseless bindings)"

The weight has been consistent on every one I weighed, and though the tin itself was slightly damaged, every pellet I've loaded was fine.  They are a tight fit in my Hatsan 95QE.  I have to use the cap of a Bic pen to seat these all the way inside the leade.  However, even when I am lazy and do not properly seat them, they are quite accurate.  Indeed, the second-most-accurate pellet I've found, in part because of the incredible consistency.

The finish is what you would expect from pricey hunting pellets: top-notch.  None of the red inserts were off center and the tin itself did not have any shavings or other debris.  The tin itself has just a push-on lid, so if you are inclined to keep the tin in your pocket when hunting, just be aware of this.

When it comes to the effect on pests, nothing comes close to these, not even my H&N Barracuda Extremes (which are a softer lead).  The polymer tip drills into the prey and the pellet head expands sufficiently to ensure a clean kill, even from a medium-powered springer like my 95QE.  I am quite happy with these and will be buying more in the future for my pest-control needs."

Inside were the horseshoes and stakes. The horseshoes are a thick plastic, heavy enough for some heft but light enough for children to toss. They are large- about Clydesdale sized or larger making them easier for children to use also. The stakes were a disappointment- they are hollow thin plastic and will be bent and ruined the first time someone stumbles over them. We will be replacing them with something sturdier. We do, however, really like the shoes so overall I can rate this as a like, but some will insist on a heavier more durable stake so take that into account.

To be perfectly honest, I am not much of a golfer but having spent time in a corporate environment I did occasionally find myself on the greens with a set of borrowed clubs (this would have been great to practice on before embarrassing myself on the actual course). One of my employees is an avid golfer, so I enlisted his help in evaluating this very cool product. We set this up in our training room and used a projector, which made this a lot of fun!

Includes: The main unit w/ 10' USB cable, Tees, and two foam golf balls

Installation: All of the software must be downloaded from the OptiShot website and the installation was very easy overall

Pros-
+ Easy Setup; we had this up and running in under a half-hour from unboxing to taking our first swing
+ Quality; both the hardware and software feel very professional
+ Calibration; the process is very easy, reading 15 test swings to get the information the system needs
+ Accuracy; the system accurately and realistically reads the users swing and displays the shot
+ Course Selection; there are a lot of courses to choose from (downloaded when installing) and a lot that can be purchased on-line

Cons-
- Instructions; very few instructions are provided but the software was easy enough to figure out using the on-screen prompts
- Putting; we had difficulty getting this to accurately reflect the stroke but it is close enough

This is a fun and very useful simulator that will last for many years!

Highly Recommended!

It never saturates, so no more squeezing out the sweat out of your band like you do with your fabric bands.
Channels sweat away from eyes and glasses. just make sure to position the gutter evenly so the sweat won't get into your ear.
its low profile design makes it perfect for cycling just as it is for running with a cap on.
Maintenance free!!! Just rinse it off, no more laundry or wash and dry drip the in the shower.

This is avery clever product, I found about it while researching if a product like that existed since I had this idea as
well. Im glad someone already thought about it and made it happen, saved me a lot of time and money.

I bought one for my father whos a very heavy sweater, he told me this is the best BDay present ever.

Definitely recommend it."

Overall I'm pleased with how they performed, no issues with any leaks and even withstood a few spills into the river where I landed hard on my knees on some rocks. I was able to stay warm enough with good layering.

The fit on these are pretty good. I bought the standard medium size, I'm 5' 7"". about 185 lbs, and wear a size 11 shoe. My only real issue with the fit are around the calf area, they are a bit tight. A little more material in this area would be a good idea.

The feet on these are HUGE. Even though they're supposed to fit a size 10.5 foot max, they easily fit my size 11 feet with lots of room to spare. When you get wading boots for these get a size larger than your normal size or I don't think you'll be able to fit your feet into the boots.

The wader belt that comes with these is adequate but tends to loosen up as you move around, so I needed to check and adjust it a few times during the day. I'll probably replace that with a different belt.

One issue I did have is that the soles of the neoprene boots did not really keep my feet as warm as I would have liked. I needed to double up on the wool socks, one pair wasn't really adequate to keep my feet warm. This is really the only major complaint I have with these waders."

I would normally wait until wearing an item like this for a few months before writing a review, but from the minute I touched it, I understood why it has a lifetime warranty.

The belt is very thick and stiff, so perfect for IWB and OWB holsters of all types. Even a full sized pistol would be nicely supported by this belt.

What really strikes me about the Ultimate Carry belt is how nice it looks. From the finish of the leather to the buckle, this thing is really sharp.

As for fit, my waist is between a 31 and 32. Based upon the fit chart, I chose the 36"" belt which was spot on. When carrying OWB, there is plenty (but not excessive) left over slack. That means it should nucelly accommodate an IWB holster too. My recommendation is to rely upon the fit chart ... but don't fret. If the belt doesn't fit the Relentless Tactical will exchange it quickly at no charge.

Buy this belt. You won't regret it."

I  called product support which was supportive.  They thought it might be screw quality issue: I happened to get soft screws. Based on that, they are sending me (at no charge) longer straps and hardware with the old hole design which we all hope works for me.  Ideally, this review process leads to a better product.  Try the straps . Worry that you may strip out screws, but they will make good on the product .

My less than perfect rating comes from the fact that I miss a couple of tools and has nothing to do with any quality issues.  I realized later that the Sportsman has the fingernail file.  Given the choice again, all other things being equal, I would probably choose the Sportsman instead of the Sportsman II.  The knife seems well made as the same great quality I expect from a Swiss Army knife.  I also ask should I have gotten the Tinker as it has the phillips screwdriver instead of the cork screw or maybe even the Super Tinker as it adds the scissors.  I have no use for the cork screw.  I do not often open a wine bottle away from my home and the time I did, I just pushed the cork down into the bottle and poured for my wife and I.  This knife fits and carries well in my pants pocket without too much weight or bulk.  It does not pull down on my pants.  It has newer style of handle that is the rough dark red instead of the polished bright red.  I like the texture of this one better.  I like having the two sharp cutting knife blades.  One is shorter and stronger.  They keep an edge for a long time and sharpen easy too.  The tip of the can opener has a small flat screwdriver tip that will fit it and work for many phillips screws.  I really like having both the can opener and bottle opener.  I have used both several times.  I do a fair amount of backpacking and the reamer can be used as a leather or heavy material punch and needle to sew with.  I love it and I got a great deal on it at a local store.  I am thinking if the Super Tinker is not too heavy I may move to it because it has the phillips screwdriver blade and scissors.  I do miss scissors and I think I would use the screwdriver more than the corkscrew but then it adds the package hook which no absolutely no use for at all.  If that, then why go for the Deluxe Tinker and get the pliers too?  I think this is part of the design.  If the perfect knife is always just out of reach then we have to buy more so we have the tool we need. And then there is the saw blade...All in all a great knife and I have no plans for getting rid of it."

I'm using the paddle method as I want to attach the holster to my body easily. Pulling it away from me is difficult. I tend to think if you can pull the holster from my body while it's in the paddle configuration my bullets wouldn't stop you.

The stitching is very secure and uniform, something I really look into when purchasing bags.  It is breathable and comfortable to carry.  I like the extra compartment for a laptop or tablet.  It is not very thin, it has some padding to it but it is definitely not bulky.  It comes with a simple bag for your mat that seems to fit any standard mats.  The purple bag is really neat, goes with the gym clothes we have.  Very pleased with the bag, it's about 20 inches in length (or a little less).  Good competitive price - at the time of this review, for the quality.

I will not give it a 5 star only because I want to reserve that for truly excellent products. In most categories I can think of I would give this knife better than very good.  The knife was extremely sharp right out of the box, the blade was centered, it is comfortable in my hand, it is a beefy knife - feels beefier than it's four ounce weight and it was a great value.  The only two things I can think of that would improve it for me is a better steel and I like the clips where the knife doesn't show hardly at all.  It is a little fat for my tastes, but that really shouldn't take away from the rating.

Pros:
Super sharp right out of box
Smooth to open
Great value
Fit and finish - no apparent blade wobble
Feels and appears very strong
Blade centered well
Blade material etched into the blade
Clip can be positioned front back tip up tip down
Thumb gimping
Did I mention it is super sharp

Cons
Made in a communist country
Kind of heavy
Not the best steel - but not really poor either"

I just finished doing back & chest exercises using the door anchor and it'll be perfect using it for inner/outer thighs. You also don't need a door if you just want to use these alone, which is what I do like about this as opposed to the TRX or similar to that.

The removable top compartment is also a bonus, I tend to keep my toiletry and personal items in there, so I can just pop it off and take it to the bath house, or keep it near my head for easy access at night. The lower compartment is the perfect size to fit my sleeping pad and down bag in. The lower compartment can also zip open for one big compartment. With the lower compartment opened up, and the top compartment adjusted all the way out, I can use the whole capacity of the Pack, which works out perfect to store my down bag uncompressed. Only thing I really wish this pack had is a couple small pockets on the belt. But there are attachment points on the belt to add some, although I have not yet found the right pockets to add."

I had to use the big seatpost clamp on the handlebars and even that barely reached around.

I'm pleased with the bright colors and the stretchy material and it came nicely packed with a picture on the front of the wrapping illustrating the various ways to use the headband.  I'm mostly a simple headband type, so now that I've played with it I will probably cut it in half and thus have two headbands that aren't quite as bulky.  Because the edges aren't finished this is a simple task, and so far the edges seem resistant to fraying.  I'm happy with this headband and like the fun patriotic vibe it gives!"

I recommend adjusting it using fully loaded magazines. Adjusting it using empty magazines you will realize that the adjustment is too loose for loaded magazines and they will fall out during movement. Allows me to save real estate on my belt. Blade-Tech mounting system works very well. You don't need to remove your belt to put it on.

So we're going too get a lot of question around ""Will it work with XYZ pistol?"". So let me try to help out my current pistol (see above) has a 13/16"" mag well. I also bought this for a friend who has an MP 9 and it fits those mags as well. I think this model will fit most double stack magazines. for single stack your going to need to check out Blade-Tech's site for specific pistols. I actually called Blade-Tech and the person i spoke with was very helpful in making sure I bought the correct model. Mileage will vary.

Cinch sacks that are long and narrow are hard to find. Most are designed in a teardrop, backpack style that wouldn't work for kayak equipment.

The medium size of this bag - 22"" length and 8"" width - is perfect for packing eight collapsible kayak paddles (kayak paddles for our family's 2 singles, 1 double). The 12 pole pieces fit comfortably in one bag along with the hand pump, while the eight blades fit in another bag. Cinch the top closed and you're all set. The compression bag's reinforced bottom helps keep the poles from punching out through the fabric. I cut off the straps that would normally be used to compress the bags' contents.

It's an ingenious solution to transporting awkward, cumbersome and pokey poles. Once the paddles are assembled, simply roll up the bag(s), cinch tie it and stuff it in your boat.

As some reviewers have mentioned, these gloves do not have a lot of padding on the palms and they do tend to run a bit on the snug side until they wear in and stretch out some.
While padding on the palms is minimal I can attest that they still give you reasonable protection in a spill. I really like how much ""feel"" you get without all the padding. The padding really only seems to be in the extra sewn in patches near the thumb and heel of the palm and even then is much thinner than what you find on traditional cut finger road style gloves. The clarino palm material looks and feels a lot like leather but stays soft and cleans well when washed.

The backing breathes very well even though it feels pretty solid. There are extra flex zones on the first two fingers since that is what you would flex the most when braking. The backing does not have a lot of padding but still seems to give decent protection both against the above mentioned spills as well as trailside weeds and twigs hitting your hands.

I have ridden with these gloves on hot 100 degree plus day rides this summer as well as some high altitude morning rides this fall where my water bottle was turning to slush. As mentioned, they do breathe well but have also kept me reasonably comfortable when I thought I might need some additional bulk or layering. They were not enough to keep warm on the really cold rides as mentioned above. On a couple of rides I have simply worn a pair of cheap one size fits all stretchy fabric gloves over these. The layering worked wonders and my hands stayed relatively warm considering what the temps really were. These gloves were worn on rides ranging from quick after work rides to day long epic rides in Moab and Grand Junction and performed flawlessly all day long.

I also like the absorbent material sewn into the back of the thumbs. Works great for wiping off a sweaty brow or cheek or for cleaning up after the inevitable sinus clearing while riding.

I did have a small section of stitching begin to come loose right on the inside of the palm/thumb area. A call to the manufacturer as listed in their warranty support page on the web had a replacement pair on it's way with no cost to me shipping back to them. Amazing customer service on the part of Giro. Kudos there!

The Good:
Great blend of comfort vs feel vs protection.
Good materials
Excellent design for what these gloves were designed to do/be.
Washable
Manufacturer warranty/support.
Great Value

The Bad:
Minor manufacturing flaw that was handled quickly and efficiently by the manufacturer (site states lifetime warranty)
Sizing may be a little snug for some but seem to loosen up to nice snugness after worn a bit.

Bottom line, if you are looking for some serious impact protection to go along with your full body armor and 40 pound downhill bike, you should probably look elsewhere for some gloves with more padding and protection, but if you are looking for some great all around dirt gloves for XC and Trail riding I would highly recommend these."

It took me a leisurely 3 hours from 2 unopened boxes on the floor to complete setup and clean up. There is a lot of cardboard and packing material to get rid of.  After a month of use I find it is a smooth and solid home gym.  The consistent resistance is great.  Much better than the Bowflex.  Pulley and seat changes with my arthritic hands takes a bit of time, but with judicious organization of exercise routines I don't have to do it often.  Resistance changes are a snap.  The foot straps are a pain.  I bought some 5 way hand grips from Bowflex (less than $20 with shipping) to use instead.  And some of the leg exercises they show being done while lying on the floor require your feet to be near your ears in the starting position. (That's not happening at my age (60+)). If you eliminate duplicate exercises done with one hand instead of 2, there are a lot less than 100 exercises.  But there were enough for me to set up 3 different routines with only a couple of exercises duplicated.  The only problem I had was with the end caps coming off the frame tubes.  Some silicone took care of that.  I am very happy with the Bio Force.  And also very pleased with Amazon's price and delivery of the unit.  I actually went to a Sports Authority store to buy one a few months ago, but no one would wait on me.  Their loss, my gain."

1.  The blade comes with a good edge.
2.  Economical design to keep the cost low without severely compromising the blade quality.
3.  Pocket clip (if you have a pocket large enough to store this thing).
4.  The steel handle is quite smooth and very comfortable.

The cons:
1.  A knife with a pocket clip should not be this big.  It's difficult to wear.
2.  The steel quality seems okay, but I wouldn't trust this thing in the field when compared to a fixed blade knife.
3.  The worst con is the unsafe blade release.  You pull the dark ""rip cord"" while holding the knife and that allows the blade to release and drop back into the handle.  It's a tight release and would be easy to cut your fingers.  Because of that, I would not recommend this knife to anyone nor will I ever use.  I have been trying to give it to someone who can use it, but so far I have no takers because of the awkward release."

I even wear them outside for short trips like walking the dog etc. The shoe will stretch some but NOT enough to be comfortable.  Anyway; order one size up and you should be happy!!!

The first thing I noticed when I received this Driftsun vest was the impressive quality of construction - from the outer shell to the inflation mechanism this is an exceptional personal flotation device. The entire outer skin is made of tear-resistant 300 denier poly fabric to give the vest the durability to last a long time. The inflating mechanism utilizes a 33g Co2 cylinder and bobbin which is standard in these type vests. The thing I like most about this particular PFD is that Velcro is used instead of breakaway zippers, this makes inflation a whole lot easier. This vest is fully adjustable and lightweight making it a lot more comfortable to wear all day - and when a PFD is comfortable people wear them more often and lives are saved. The vest is also able to be manually inflated and deflated through a built in inflation tube. This vest will inflate at about 5 seconds after being submersed and can be auto-inflated by pulling the pull cord.  There is a safety whistle attached to the inflation tube and the inner vest has reflective material. The vest comes with a comprehensive user manual that is easy to read.

Before you use a PFD vest I would highly recommend that you get very familiar with the components as well as test out the buoyancy and check for leaks. The easiest way to do this is to inflate the vest through the oral inflation tube. The Driftsuns inflation tube can also be used to adjust the amount of air in the vest by adding or deflating until you have the desired buoyancy. After inflating the vest leave it inflated overnight and check it the next day. Make sure that the vest has maintained the inflation and then deflate the vest (invert the cap from the blow tube and press into the tube while squeezing the air from the bladder) and repack according to the provided instructions. You should also check the bobbin for the date stamp and make sure that it is less than 3 years old, if not get a new one. If you want extra Co2 cylinders and bobbins this PFD uses the 33g with 1/2 inch threads.

I like this vest a lot, its extremely comfortable and very well made. The vest allows free range of motion while Im out fishing and still keeps me safe. I would recommend this vest to anyone using watercraft, or working or playing in or near water.

I received the Driftsun life vest at a discounted cost in exchange for an unbiased review and appreciate the universal sizing, and am impressed with the stellar quality and the great design."

I bought these knives because they looked interesting.  They were made by spyderco, ok WIN.  They were tiny, This could be the deal breaker.  Ive had small knives before and they just aren't sharp and won't get sharp.  These knives are really sharp!!  They slice through paper with ease they don't tear it or anything they leave nice clean cuts.  The smallest one is by far the sharpest out of the box, your mileage may vary but mine was.

Now to size the smallest one is IMHO on the verge of being useless as a pocket knife, maybe a lady could carry one in her coin purse but is tiny.  It does how ever fit very nicely on a keychain.  I put mine on my keys and with the extra length my keys add the little knife is comfortable to use.  It cant be used for much but it should be fine for opening a snack that won't open or opening letters.  Heck even removing those annoying strings that come out of your t shirts should be simple with this knife.  Well worth the money.

Medium knife.  Im on the wall with this knife.  Its too big for my keychain, I don't like a lot of bulk and useless garbage on my keys and this knife is just too big.  Its also too small for an EDC knife IMHO.  Im having a hard time finding a use for it.

Largest knife.  PERFECT EDC blade.  Its small enough not to be a hassle in your pocket but not so small that its easily lost or unable to perform basic slipjoint tasks.  I wouldnt use it for anything heavy duty but for basic cutting tasks its great.  Dont get me wrong I love my various Kershaws, Spydercos, Bucks, Zero Tolerance, and Cold Steel knives, but they are a bit big and not really something I would feel comfortable taking out in public to use."

It was very easy to put together, although mine came with two extra bolts that I didn't need and was missing one that I did need. A quick trip to the hardware store and a $.75 bolt solved the problem.

It holds one or two bikes very nicely but I did find it necessary to use another strap through both wheels and around the upright part of the rack for extra security.

I really like that it folds down so I can open the rear hatch on my Ford Escape to access anything I need in the back of the SUV. I've very happy with it and I recommend it."

I returned the paddle to Dick's and while I was waiting in line I ordered this paddle.
If u don't know what size paddle you need this is the process or at least how the Dick's rep explained it to me. Stand up straight, extend arm straight up vertical with your body, middle finger should extend 1"" pass the paddle. However, the paddle can extend up to 4-6"" past finger. I am 6 foot, paddle measures 243cm or 8' which extends 4"" pass my middle finger.
I gave it a 3 star review due to a gash in one paddle and 2 deep indentations on the grips. No negative baring for a novice Yaker like myself but disappointed in the Quality Control considering the UPS box was in mint condition."

This is my first scope so i do not really know how good this scope is compared to the more expensive models but it worked as it should for me. I did have a difficult time sighting my rifle at 100 yards though. This may be due to my inexperience in sighting a scope. Overall i like this scope but i am giving this scope a 4 star because when focused the image is still slightly blurred. Does not impact shooting experience much unless you are doing precise shooting (at targets more than a 100yards)  which needs to get the shot to an exact dot.

I moved and carried my whole life in and on this pack for a week or so and it performed great.
I've owned it for two years and used it a ton for trips and as a gear sack for driving trips and it's still holding up like new.
I wish it had a few more sturdy straps to attach gear, but what it has is definitely good enough.
The sleeping bag pouch is a little small for a normal 0-20 degree sack, so I just leave the divider unzipped and carry one either stuffed inside or attached on the outside.
The side pockets and flap pockets are great for snacks and gear that needs to be accessible. The mesh side pockets are perfect for anything with the circumference of a 32oz Nalgene bottle or smaller."

The problem is when I tried to use them on my tire, I really got the impression they would rip it up if I tried to slide them along underneath, to say nothing of what they'd do to my rim.  Plus they weren't as thin as I'd hoped, so I ended up going back to my LBS plastic set.  I guess I should mention I was trying to remove the stock Kendas that have seen 1400+ miles and are now completely bare, and a real, real pain to take off and put back on, so maybe my expectations are unrealistic.  I've upgraded to a set of Vittorias that slip on and off with ease, but again, I'm too nervous of tearing up the bead to try these levers on them.

UPDATE 3/19/2013:  Confirmed.  Yesterday I had such a hard time installing my new tires I actually snapped off the ends of two hard plastic levers.  In desperation I turned to these, and sure enough, they scratched the heck out of my rims and punctured two tubes in the process.  I ended up bringing the tire to my LBS because it had been hours and my fingers felt like they were ready to fall off (best $7 I ever spent).  Did anyone test these things on actual tires before selling them?  Absolutely terrible."

Update:  As suggested by two commenters, this mystery indicator *does* do something -- every 5 minutes it shows another bar.  My follow-up question, then, has to be ""WHY???""  What use is this feature?  The little bars inside the mystery circle are tiny and very difficult to see. So why take up space on the watch face for that?  Seems like a poor use of space.  I'd much rather have no third circle, in return for slightly larger time digits as are on some other G-Shock models."

2793,1974,Male,60000,647.7799321403578,No,No,Midwest,MI,4,"08 14, 2015",Marathoner versus the Ultra 4,"I debated between the Marathoner or Ultra 4 but couldn't find any online comparisons. So, I ordered both to see for myself.

The dimensions of the packs are nearly identical. The CamelBak websites gives different measurements for both packs but, when lying one inside the other, I could not see any difference, other than the obvious fact that the back pockets in the Ultra 4 mean that it will be thicker if used for storage. The bladders are identical, and both have easy access to refill. The weight is also nearly identical--the Ultra 4 weighed 2.5 oz more according to my kitchen scale. They both have the same adjustment options. I thought that the Marathoner felt slightly more comfortable to put on, empty, but my husband also tried both and said they felt identical to him. The front of the vests are identical in size and storage. The front of both packs will hold your phone in the waterproof compartment, two water bottles (I had to use my smaller 10 oz water bottles. Full sized ones felt too bulky in front on my petite frame), and a small easy-access compartment. For my first trial run, I took one water bottle on one side and some powerbeans in the other, and keys and whistle in the easy access area. That pretty much was all the front would hold. For anything else I wanted, I would have to rely on the pack compartments. So, if you are debating between the two packs, the only difference is the storage in back.

There is a stretch overflow pocket in the back of the Marathoner. It easily fit my run jacket. I'm sure it would expand enough to hold a sweatshirt, and even gloves and hats if stuffed under the sweatshirt. There is a bungy cord to hold it tight, but small slits along either side at the top that enables it to stretch, so I could not trust it to hold small, loose items. For those, there is a small key storage compartment under the flap to access the bladder. It will hold keys and a wallet. I was originally hopeful that the Marathoner would have some additional storage by slipping supplies in with the bladder, as I do on my day pack (fill the bladder with ice water and it keeps my snacks cool). However, the bladder fits tightly in with really no means of accessing the compartment when holding a bladder.

The Ultra 4 has a long, thin zippered compartment on the very front. The zipper runs vertically. It's perfect for stashing shot blocks and gel packets. The next pocket runs the length of the pack. There is a key loop inside at the top and a divided section that's the depth of my hand. There's a mesh zippered compartment along that front of that compartment, so you have three storage areas in the largest front pocket. That, too, stretched to hold my light jacket. I doubt it would zip if holding a sweat shirt. The bladder compartment also zippers open along the top and you can reach all the way inside, so there's the option of slipping supplies in there, too.

So, my suggestion if you are debating between the two packs:
- If you have to bring small items with you that you want to know are secure, use the Ultra 4 (Personally, I took a spill and my inhaler and eye drops stayed securely in the back of the Ultra 4. I think they would have fallen out of the back overflow pocket of the Marathoner).
- If you want to bring a lot of snacks with you and have easy, sortable access to them, use the Ultra 4.
- If you are going to bring lots of shed layers with you, I suspect the Marathoner's stretchy, open back pocket will stretch further to hold a bulky sweatshirt.
- If you're worried about visibilty at night, the back of the Marathoner has a longer reflective area. I don't see much reflective on the back of the Ultra 4 and personally would clip a light onto it for dark runs.

In the end, I went with the Ultra 4 and it was very comfortable. Like the Marathoner, there are two chest straps in front. They slide up and down for adjustment. The bottom one is elastic so you can take deep breaths comfortably. The shoulder straps attach with velcro and have stitched markings so you can adjust their length and angle. The side adjustments are easy to access on the run so you can tighten the pack down as you run and drain water. The panels are mesh. I ran 2.5 hours in the Tucson summer and my back was no dripping with sweat. The sloshing noise was annoying--a friend said that, after filling the pack, you hold it upside down, tube access on top, and blow all the water out of the tube and back into the pack. Then suck out all the air. Genius. I can't wait to try it.

A note on color: from pictures, the Marathoner looked like it came in a purple and red option. Really, it was a purplish pink. Not screaming bubble-gum, hot pink, but definitely pink."

This Wagner Flexio 590 Indoor/Outdoor Hand Held Sprayer System will give me the professional smooth finishes I need in my painting in way, way less time. This system comes with the X-Boost Turbine handle, the iSpray nozzle, the detail finish nozzle, 2 filters in the Turbine handle, 2 funnels, a practice spray poster, thinning accessory, a carrying case to hold everything in and the owner's manual.  The directions are extremely thorough and after reading everything and practicing using this sprayer's 2 different nozzles, you will be so pleased with the perfect professional results, you will not want to use a brush or roller ever again.

As with all paint jobs, prep work is everything, and it is no different with a hand held sprayer. You want to clean whatever it is you are painting first and mask the border. I found the overspray to be minimal with this sprayer, but masking is still needed. Once you are ready for painting, just be sure you do a couple of practice sprays first, to get the feel of the sprayer and to see how keeping the handle straight and steady with even sweeping motions will keep the sprayer from spitting or spraying too thin or thick. You'll see that moving constantly and distance is everything also. When you first use the practice poster with the iSpray nozzle, you will see that you will be 6-12 inches away to get a spray of 10 to 12 inches wide. Then when you practice with the detail finish nozzle, you'll find you'll spray 1 to 6 inches away for a spray 1/2 inch to 3 inches wide. Steady, straight sweeping motions will give you perfect results.

Once you mix the material you will be using, you will want to adjust the controls by setting your air power and material flow control. The materials you use with the iSpray nozzle can be from thin sealers to medium polyurethanes to heavy latex paints or primers. The incredible thing about this iSpray nozzle is that you don't have to thin the materials with water. You can thin them if you like, as it will mean cleaning the nozzle hole less while painting, but I found that when I sprayed constantly and steadily for a while the sprayer didn't clog or spit until I stopped to rest my arm and began again. At this point I simply unclogged the sprayer hole with the thinning accessory, did a practice spray and went back to spraying again. The thinning accessory tells you how much water to add to the container to thin your paint or material besides having a tip to keep the nozzle hole clean.

As for the detail finish nozzle, this sprayer hole is so tiny, you absolutely have to thin your material no matter what you are using to paint or stain with. Thinning is a must for this detail nozzle and you will be impressed with the perfect results you will get. For both nozzles, you can adjust the spray shape, but you can only adjust the spray width on the iShape nozzle. The owner's manual also covers proper spraying techniques for both wide and detailed spraying. I find that simply practicing will give you all you need in learning distance and adjustments to get the results you need. When finished painting, cleanup is unbelievably easy. You basically want to flush the unit with water half full for water based materials or one quarter full of mineral spirits for oil based materials. After flushing, you just take the nozzle apart and I just let it soak in a bucket of soapy water. Then take a soft brush to it, dry and remember to use vaseline on the O ring before putting it back together again. The reassembly of the nozzle is pictured in the manual, so you don't have any worries after it's apart in pieces. The only maintenance you'll have is cleaning the 2 filters and cleaning the air valve tube on the iSpray nozzle.

Painting is a huge job, with lots of prep work and cleanup time, so anything that cuts down on the actual time spent painting is a huge plus for me and this Wagner sprayer makes it so much easier with it's super fast wide and detailed sprayers, which can be mastered with just a little practice. Walls, baseboards, trims, ceilings, fences, house siding, furniture, decks and even crafts turn out with a beautiful professional smooth finish when spraying with this great sprayer system and it is definitely a 4 1/2 Star time saver."

I would think that a company marketing to a U.S. consumer base would get someone who actually spoke English well to write the manual. Both alarms worked initially out of the boxes, but shortly both started acting up, malfunctioning and making weird noises. One buzzed loudly when connecting the battery or pressing the B button. The other would not accept a new passcode entry. After removing and re-installing the batteries repeatedly, I was finally able to get both alarms working. Had to set the sensitivity to highest setting for a quick response to movement. Had no issues installing the hardware after reading other reviews suggesting adding washers to the nuts and bolts holding the alarm in place. Wish the alarm was louder, but it does make noticeable noise. I am also curious how these alarms will hold up to an Arizona summer."

I love the colors, very me, goes with everything I have. I go to the gym about twice a week and other than that I work out at home. I have various work outs that i do but they all cause me to sweat. This towel definitely  helps with that. i also like it because if I forget my yoga mat and need to use one of the gyms I can put this down and not have to worry about germs and sweating on it. I haven't used the hooks yet except I like to carry the towel that way, instead of draped over my arm I slip them over my fingers and I have a free hand to hold my gym bag or water. This towel washes nicely too. I have washed it twice so far, cold, delicate, air dry. The only struggle I have is getting it back into the bag. This will take some practice. Like, fold in half, fold in half, one more time the other way, roll and stuff. Sometimes I just give up and leave it out of the bag. The bag is handy in other ways though, I actually out in a pair of socks, they fit nicely.
I usually keep my gym bag in my car and it is nice to just have a towel handy. My daughter spilled her water all over some books in the back so i used this towel to help clean up. very handy indeed! It is winter right now, so we don't go out much, But I will most likely bring this with my to the beach or out to our pool. I'm happy with it.

You just put it down where you see the ant trail the they flock to it.  It has a sugar or something they like.  They take it back to their nests and in about 4 to 6 days you don't see them anymore.  One tip for success is wait for about 3 or 4 days without a rain forecast before you lay it down.  This will give them plenty of time to feed on it.  One drawback is that if it gets stored in a hot UPS truck it gets becomes watery and is hard to put on.  The entire box of the last shipment I had was useless and the manufacturer had me try to put it in the refrigerator for 24 hours but that only helped a bit, so they replaced the product.  That was a little runny but not bad.  I suggest putting it in the frig 24 hours before you are going to use, so it is a little firmer.  It works much better than Ant Traps and was recommended to me by a pest control specialist I had as a client at work.  He uses it regularly as do many other professional pest control companies."

Seems plenty warm for the camping trip this weekend and I love how small it wraps up. I live in central California and used this while camping at the World Superbike races at Laguna Seca where  it was pretty windy and chilly at night and this sleeping bag handled the  50 Degree F nights just fine. We had a blast at the races and the temperature differential from day to night had me worried.  I was worried that the high day temperature (felt hot because of the sun beating on us) would make the nights seem colder but this little guy worked well.  I have a lot of camping gear and a rather small car so a sleeping bag that wraps up this small is perfect! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review. The aforementioned discount did not influence my review in anyway. If you need a mild temp sleeping bag (can't speak for higher temps or low temperature uses) this sleeping bag will work well."

Measured things up and this case came up to my needs. The little '94 fit perfect with 4"" of stock protruding from case. It also fit my Rem 870 Deer Shotgun, but is rather tight for the forend and the butt extends out from the pistol grip. The scabbard is well padded on the sides with a nylon shell covering. A drain hole rivet is located on strap side near muzzle. Seams are basted with nylon edge tape. Strap D rings are attached with square ""X"" sewing pattern. The strap itself is 1-1/2"" adjustable utility strap with flat spring hooks. There are 4 Molle attachment panels (2 per side). The CONS: The carrying strap is just a grab & pickup strap. For a hiking strap, I am putting a modified M60 padded gunner's sling on using sliding ""D's"". The Molle strap snaps pop open rather easily for me. This may be a problem when attaching to the pack, but some locking ties may help. I wouldn't recommend this scabbard as ""jump"" case.

Overall I rate it a 5 Star for being well made and fitting my needs. It looks more like a milspec pool cue case when shouldered and doesn't attract a lot of attention when carrying in town.

Because of the wide range of manufacturing tolerances of the M91-30, the scope mount is pretty loose. The instructions point out you need to level the mount (pretty obvious) and if you put your Mosin in a gun vice and level it, you can easily level the base. Blue lock-tite is a must.

I also like that Brass Stacker put all the parts in the instructions - just in case you drop that little lock washer and can't find it, you know what size to go get.  I also like that the Brass Stacker does not require any changes to the bolt - it's far enough forward so as to not interfere with the bolt, even when wearing gloves.  Of course this means you can only use a long eye relief scope.

I highly recommend this mount, and will be buying another for my other M91-30.

UPDATE: Bought second one for my second M91/30.  As fate would have it, the second rifle's pins were soldered in and I had to take a torch to the pins to melt the solder.  Well, I melted it, but I also took the tension out of the sight spring, so now it just flops.  Since this rifle has mismatched serial numbers, I decided to make this my fun gun, and the first M91/30 is going to be my showpiece.  The flopping rear sight tucks into the Brass Stacker, so that's not a problem - just irritating knowing I damaged it.

I recommend tapping your rear sight pins first BEFORE YOU BUY (unless you are Joe Handy with the torch or don't mind messing up the spring steel in the sight).  If I knew my pins were soldered, I would have taken it to a gunsmith and learned how to heat the pins without detensioning the spring."

Blaze orange color means you won't lose this knife in the woods,"I almost lost a Kershaw Storm while out working in the woods.  Fortunately I found it after some searching, but it took awhile.  I saw this blaze orange knife on Amazon and ordered it.  After receiving it I immediately put it to use.  Here are some pros and con to consider:

PROS
1. The zytel handles (no metal liners) make it very light.  Nubs molded into the handles make it grippy.
2. The blaze orange color makes it difficult to lose.
3. The build quality is very good for a $20 knife.
4. The knife is strong enough for light to medium cutting chores.
5. Lock-up is tight and solid with no blade play in any direction.
6. The pocket clip is very tight...almost too tight.
7. AUS8a is a solid mid-tier steel.  Unbeatable at this price point.
8. The knife came shaving sharp from the factory.

CONS
1. One handed deployment is difficult.  I would not use this as a tactical knife.
2. Thumb stud is one on side only (set for right hand carry).  The stud is swichable, but Ka-Bar really could have spent an extra 5 cents to put a stud on both sides.

For a utility/outdoors/EDC knife that you won't mind using and abusing, it is an incredible value.  Buy it...now."

The first season I had these tires they were really something. Fantastic performance.
The second season has left me pretty bummed out. First off - I slipped for the first time EVER with studded tires. Happened so fast there was nothing I could do about it.
Secondly, the tires seem to be rapidly decaying. I have had been getting a nasty string of flat tires and it has really tested my patience. I can't quite seem to diagnose the problem and have installed kevlar tire liners as an extra barrier. I am still getting flats. When I look at the tire from the inside all of the stud mounts seem to be wearing into the tube and are severely angled and coming out.

I ride 26 miles round trip every day so I realize that I'm putting these under some pretty heavy use. And I am on my second winter with them. That being said, I'd have liked to get at least two full winters (Late November - March) without incident. That has not been the case.

I have the Schwalbe Winter Marathons on my other bike and have purchased them again for my commuter. Schwalbe continues to be the gold standard and I will not buy the Nokians again.

But - if you are riding low miles (sub 10) and are very price conscious, these may be worth a try. My first year they were great, but have serious longevity issues."

The green seemed about right for me, 175lb male. I also bought 4 different Cando flexible hand bars: red (light), green(medium), blue(heavy), and black(x-heavy). All four colors felt about the same. To check my sense of feel, I measured the force required to bend the bars to 90 degrees. The forces were as follows: red- 10.2 lb, green- 8.2lb, blue- 11.2lb, black- 10.4lb. The Cando bars appear to be trying to compete with the There-Band ""Flexbar"". Using my measurements the force to bend these bars 90 degrees are red- 2.3lb, green- 4.3lb, blue- 6.5lb. All the Cando bars are too stiff. It is clear to me that there is no concern about quality by the makers of the Cando bar.

This one looked perfect. When we set it up the first time in the back yard all was pretty good except a couple of the poles didn't want to go together all the way. Made for it being very tight and hard to the get in place at the bottom. After it was up it was nice and roomy and would be perfect. We left it up for 2 more days since rain was in the forecast. Always test your tent before taking on the road!! It rained for about 3 hours. Average amount, not pounding but more than a sprinkle. Afterwards we went out to see how it had preformed. Big pond in the back corner and the inside walls were wet! The rainfly works but anything below that does not. It comes in around the windows really bad. If there was an after market fly that covered the whole tent I would get it. Since there is not I couldn't take the risk of getting flooded on a camping trip. Once again, ALWAYS test a new tent before taking it on the road."

First and foremost, the insulation is a bit iffy. I would not use this for anything I was intended to hold unrefrigerated for hours at a time, especially on a hot day. I recommend using blue ice blocks to encourage the insulation along. Additionally, the design, while generous, is a bit off. When not zipped closed, the soft sides will collapse, so don't anticipate that this will stand upright as you work with it. The shoulder strap is not conveniently placed for carrying on your shoulder. Now, that being said, this is a very generously constructed cooler bag that will serve you well for the short term. The price is good, it is attractive and I had no trouble with the zippers. It's easy to fold up and tuck away, as opposed to a solidly built cooler that you can't reduce in size. Therefore, I give this a three star recommendation -- good for what you need but not fabulous. A sample was provided in exchange for an honest review, and I do think I've been pretty honest! It just might be perfect for you!"

Honestly, I was worried at first at how ""skimpy"" it seems and some accounts that stated that the finger tips would turn.  But I had no problems.  I gave this glove a chance because I'm not one for bulky items and preferred a more streamlined look that would give me more options.  As I started using these, I found that not only was it an excellent glove that afforded me those options, but  in fact, there were some unanticipated pluses that came with it as well:

1.  It's adjustable.  In fact, this glove can fit bigger hands than myself.  for my hands, I had to adjust it to the third notch up from the wrist.  How does adjusting work?  Look at the pictures.  See those holes near the wrist?  Those are used to adjust the size.  What isn't as easily seen is that there is a leather string/lace that is very easy to undo and then tie up.  It's hard to explain here, but what I will say is before you undo it once you receive the glove, take note of how they tied it.  It's just a two-step procedure.

2.  I love that it's fastened by a buckle.  True, it's not as fast or easy to undo as velcro, but it feels a lot more secure and is more visually pleasing.

3.  The finger tips do cover well past the first joint making deep-hook draws an option for you if you so desire.  In fact, with my hands, the covers end just before my 2nd joints on the fingers.  So I still got tons of flexibility.

4.  I like the fact that it does NOT cover the entire fingers.  When nocking arrows from hip quiver to bow, I can easily grab the shafts and position it with the skin of my lower (uncovered) fingers.  For some reason, I personally prefer feeling the arrows when nocking...and it's made simple this way.

5.  At first, they will feel stiff, but the more you use them and break them in, the more you still can feel the string as the tips better mold to your fingers and become a little more flexible (just enough to be comfortable).

6.  The extra leather piece they add to the tips means your fingers don't get sore easily at all.

7.  The leather overall seems quite durable and the threading is nice and neat.

8.  Though absolutely secure in staying on my finger tips, I also found it relatively easy to slip off the tips (without removing the gloves) when necessary."

Some Tips To Keeping Them Wearing Longer...,"Ever since Thorlos' quality diminished to the point where I was replacing $11 socks every month, I'd been searching for the ideal sock. This MAY BE it. They are thick, ""cushioned"" on the inside thanks to the concentrated weave, and warm during the winter but provide insulation during the summer. Their fit (I wear the 10-13 which is a range that I thin is Large)is snug, and there's no slippage on a long hike.

Still, they're not perfect. I hike almost daily, and if I had 7 pair, I'm certain they would wear almost as badly as the Thorlos. But I have 20 pair, and I keep them in a drawer in a way so that they all get even wear, i.e., once every 20-25 days. They have lasted up to 18 months.

The flaw in this is that at $12 a pair, this will cost as much as $240 at one time, and that's a chunk of change for socks. All the more reason to reverse them (inside out) when washing them. But unlike what Wigwam suggests, I wash them inside out one week, and then ""normally"" the next time. That way I can keep the sequence straight. I have never figured out why they're supposed to be turned inside out for washing, but I'm often compliant - like a terrier puppy.

What bothers me about these Wigwams is that the price has gone up 27% in the past year. I can't afford $13.95 for a pair of socks ... especially when my ""system"" calls for 20 pair.

And then my there's my system's flaw: they all start wearing out at the same time. Logically, they shouldn't last any longer, but in actuality they do. Maybe the fibers need a rest between wearings. Maybe inverting them really works. Whatever, I've had Wigwam Merino Wool Hikers that have lasted WELL OVER over a year.

And comfort-wise, I do love these socks. When I become a multi-millionare, I won't care about the cost (and I'm having my windshield ground to prescription), but for now I have to make these last as long as possible.

However,as solid and secure as this rack is, there are a couple of design flaws.  First, the blue rubber stops that protect your frame do not secure in their cradles well. As a result, they come loose and I have lost a few just mounting my bike  on and off.  Thule has been good in replacing them, but it's a hassle to go back to the bike shop all the time.  More seriously, the right side dial for the upper cable will not disengage to release and lengthen it.  It doesn't sound like a big deal, but I have to use a screwdriver to put pressure on the spring top release it all the time and it's a pain.  For $329, I expected a lot better QC.  Thule wants to repair it but I would have to pay shipping, which is expensive  for this.  I can deal with it and it may just be my unit, but it's easier just to leave it on the trunk the whole summer.  I bought it from my LBS, not Amazon."

First of all, its a rucksack. One big bag with a drawstring tie and three pockets hung on the sides. Being used to the multi compartment hiking/book bag type of packs, this took some getting use to, but now that I have, its really is the only way to go. The material is a heavy duty canvas type of fabric and I love it. Kicking your backpack under airplane seats and train seats takes a toll on fancy upper end packs but this should last a very long time. Unlike most packs, this has no structure and just kinda collapses in a heap when empty, which makes packing it a tidbit more challenging, but deffinetly not a deal breaker. The buckles on this are strictly cosmetic and the real closures are snaps which close the pockets pretty securely. Tuck the flaps of the side pockets into the pockets and they make great water bottle holders. They are pretty big and deep so they will hold good size bottles. Mine is a size small, but has more than enough room for everything I usually carry including a fleece pullover and packable vest plus all the odds and ends you use when traveling through Europe. The retro look is very, very cool and gets attention. I actually had a gentleman seriously ask me if I was an archeologist. All in all, a solid five stars."

This product is just what I have been looking for.  I always carry my water bottle and especially when I am walking my two small dogs it get very hard to carry the water bottle and to carry the two of them.  We like to walk the nature trails and occasionally the little ones (two Yorkshire terrier, one 5 pounds the other 6 pounds) need to be carried because we normally do two plus miles and it is sometimes muddy and hard for their little feet.  So now I have no problem carrying them and my water bottle, phone, keys etc.  The water bottle says in securely unlike most flimsy ones where they keep falling out.  This is an extremely well made product.  Small and light weight but yet a lot of room for all your stuff.  The construction is as I said great ! even the straps I to tighten it. There are two straps that you pull to tighten that work great.  And an added bonus is this pack has a reflective strip for night use.  I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a waist pack that can also hold your water bottle.  LOVE this !

The bag arrived with a large gap in the seam of one of the sides, creating a huge hole. So I guess it's safe to assume that it's not watertight at all. Also, the zippered opening is way too small. It makes it difficult, and in some cases impossible, to insert any large contents. Plus, while I admittedly did not test it under water, I can almost assure you that the zipper is NOT water tight. I stuck a flashlight in the bag and I could see light seeping out at the end of the zipper...and yes, it was closed all the way.

I would suggest you look elsewhere for a watertight bag. Maybe I just got a bum bag, but then their quality control sucks. In fact, it looked like all of the seams on the bag were lifting and it was only a matter of time before the bag completely fell apart. Either way, there's zero chance that I'm trusting my valuables to be stored in this bag while out on the water."

The ease it provides of showing your shots is well worth the minimal cost for the targets. At the price of 3 for $1.00, it is a bargain. I've used these at 25 and 50 yard ranges. At 25 yards, it's very easy to see your shots. At 50 yards I was using a small spotter scope and it was much easier to spot compared to the other non-reactive targets.

Anything over 50 yards, you'll definitely need a scope of some sort to be able to see but it still makes a huge difference. The different colors as you hit the different rings is a great idea."

First of all, NO manufacturer of air pillows has yet to consistently manufacture leakproof pillows without fail.  Faulty products are just a sad reality of buying both air pillows and to some degree mattresses.  Sea to Summit is generally as good as any other brand in their quality control.  This reality of occasional leaky stitching is not a welcome one, but it is currently unavoidable.  The good news is that leaks almost always manifest early on while the pillow is still returnable.  Secondly, this is CERTAINLY not a five-star product, and I will elaborate below.

The pillow I received does not leak.  I have kept it blown up for a week at a time to test it, and found that for the most part no air escapes.  If blown up full enough and slept on daily the pillow will lose some pressure, but not enough to be noticeable over the course of a single night.

The large version of this pillow weighs exactly 4 oz on my scale without the storage sack, though my scale may not be the world's most accurate.  The construction is of an internal bladder, a highly rubber-ish material that reminds me of some kinds of pool toys or of a malleable kind of vegetable resin, surrounded by a very soft layer not unlike a quality cotton shirt.

Positives of the pillow are that it is comfortable at any level of inflation, and I am still trying to figure out what I like the best.  People wanting an ultra-firm pillow will find that this one can become quite hard if fully inflated.  Those wanting a softer pillow will find that the rubber bladder stretches more than other pillows' typically rigid plastic.  The bladder is also remarkably quiet compared to the hard crackling produced by other pillows.  The pillow DOES roll a bit more than I expected it would, when deflated, but not too much for me not to use, and I have only use a few pillows that were better.  Finally the cover is soft enough that I do not need to wrap it or bring a pillowcase, as I do with other pillows.  Even better, the material grips on to a Buff headgear so well that I can lay it on top of  the pillow and wake up in the morning to find that all of my tossing and turning (I am big for the tossing and turning) hasn't displaced the thing at all.  A very comfortable surface!

So at first impression the pillow would seem to be the culmination of a very long search for the perfect pillow.  But alas, one of THE MOST stupid design flaws that I have ever seen severely hold the pillow back.  First, let me say that the rubber bladder is a compromise.  The same characteristics that make it stretchy and crackle-free make it very susceptible to friction and in turn VERY susceptible to puncture and tearing.  The cloth cover mitigates most of this, but it is doubtless that this pillow will eventually perforate.  That SHOULDN'T be a problem, as it will probably hold a patch very well, but Sea to Summit, in what I imagine to be no more than cost-cutting measures, did not design the cover to be remove-able.  it is attached at the air nozzle, where tampering may destroy the seal, and everywhere else is seams and stitches.  This means that to repair the pillow, the seams must be opened up in order to bring the bladder into view.  Then follows the question, should someone undertake the repair, of WHICH seam to cut.  The only two big enough to draw the whole bladder out would each unravel half the pillowcase!  Whatever course one takes, there is sure to be a lot of needlework to be done, and on a material that does not look to take kindly to bad stitch jobs.

Other complaints include the lack of grip for opening up the deflation valve.  Holding on the fabric will doubtlessly degrade the condition of the pillow rapidly, so one has to dig into the cracks of the valve and pry where it is safe to tug around, which is not as easy as it should be.  The inflation valve is much better.  Also, the pillow slopes upward, but for air pillows it should not.  Other pillow manufacturers have already figured this out that it is better to slope downward or to make the pillow flat, but Sea to Summit here, too, seems to have designed without much investigation or thought.  I reverse the pillow to make it more comfortable, but I sure do with that the curve and valve were not on the opposite sides that I want.

In summary, this pillow seems to be the result of one good idea put into production before it could be researched into a good design.  The contours are not right, the valve is not yet right, and the bladder is only repairable by trading the integrity of its casing, which is simply inexcusable for an outdoors product.  Still the pillow provides a comfortable sleep (even with bad contours!) without much noise, and at a reasonable weight, so it is not a terrible product anyway, I suppose.

It all really comes down to what someone wants out of their pillow.  This is arguably the most comfortable that I have used, and could have been a total winner in that regard with a little more R&D.  If the buyer is not bivy-ing and especially if their shelter includes both a tent and a groundsheet, then the dangers of perforation may be slim enough to argue for this purchase over others.  Otherwise, one should consider the ultralight version of this pillow, with an exposed bladder, or another brand of pillow altogether."

The fit and finish are fantastic, but the deployment is tough.  The blade simply doesn't deploy nearly as easily as, say, the Sage 1, which the Chaparral's appearance so closely mimics.  I've managed to loosen it a bit through use, but I don't think this knife will ever open as easily as most of my other Spydeys.  It's a shame because it's such a truly handsome EDC blade.  I think the problem is a function of the backlock.

Hmm.  Maybe.  But my Native FRN opens very easily.  So do my Delicas and Enduras, although to be fair, almost all of those took a little break-in time.  I decided to keep the knife since it's slightly collectible, and I simply like the finish and the feel of the blade so much.  Time will tell.

It's a easy carry.  It should prove to be a sturdy, daily-use blade.  Using that rubric, most users will be very satisfied with this sweet little knife."

First, it is a large size - so much so that it doesn't fit in our washing machine.  So make sure you have a full size, huge washing machine because there is a LOT of material here.  Otherwise, you'll have to hand wash this big hulking thing or pay a lot to have it done.

Second, what the picture doesn't show you is that the top (where your head is) has an attached bag that is used for transportation - it's sewn into the top seam and takes up abotu 1/4 of a side.  It flaps around in your face all night and for the life of me, I can't figure out WHY it was designed this way. Who wants a large flappy bag where your head is?

It's also fairly thick and stiff - so this makes a horrible bed blanket, for those considering it for that purpose.  It sticks up at odd places all the time and just doesn't work - I can only hope washing over time softens it so we can get dual use out of it on cold nights indoors as well as camping.  It's also very thick and huge so it eventually wants to slide off the bed all the time.

That said, it is a lovely soft cotton, very warm but somewhat uncomfortable due to the thickness/stiffness of the fabric and filling.  But it is also clearly very high quality."

I use these with the CO2 inflator from Pro Bike  https://www.amazon.com/CO2-Inflator-Pro-Bike-Tool/dp/B017KU1DIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8
Basically the pro-tool has a valve that lets you shut off the CO2 cartridges and also allow you to control the inflation.  For example, if I have lost air (slow leak) I can add a little air.  Before changing the tube, I can add some air, then assemble the tube and tire and finish inflating.  You will need 2 cartridges for a 27.5 x 3.0 tire (B+ wheels).  You still need a mini pump just in case you have a second flat or you screw something up.  Unless you want to carry more than 2 cartridges.  For tubeless tires, you have a chance to reseat the tire bead by removing the valve core and letting one of these cartridges loose.  Just hold your finger over valve until you screw valve core back into valve.  Then you will need another cartridge to finish inflation.  Saved me on the Womble trail in AR, after 24 miles and 3 miles to the finish,  gashed my tubeless tire.  It is a pain to put a tube in, but at least I did not have to pump a 1/2 hour to inflate.

The length of the axe from the top of the axe eye ( the part with the wedge) to the bottom of the handle where the lanyard hole is is excactly 26 and 1/4 inches.

Much longer then what I expected

from the bottom of the axe head to the bottom of the axe handle is 23 1/4 inches

I don't know who is measuring these, but they are wrong

It bigger then i wanted, but is a solid great axe
the sheath is fantastic
the finish and grind are great
but I am very unhappy with the length description that is clearly wrong.

The grain orientation is great also,

what angers me the most
is that this axe has everything i wanted is just too long!!!!

I was looking for a axe similar to nessmuks, double bit axe

and know i might have to cut it down, or re handled it

everything else is stellar."

It fits the sword nice and snuggly; altho some times, for some strange reason, the sword get stuck halfway; I just pull it out and put it in the scabbard again and it fits nicely. Not sure if is a defective scabbard or if all of them are like that; but it won't really affect the experience overall. I just mentioned it, in case that someone experience the same and gets concerned that his item may be broken or defective.

The finishing is great; it match perfectly the finishing of the sword; it is pretty robust and solid, but keep in mind that the metal and the leather has to be taken care of, so once in a while use the right products (nothing too aggressive for the metal, or you may remove the aged stain that they put on it, same goes for the leather).

The only thing that tick me off a bit, is that on the back you can see 2 screws, which hold the metal finishing. I would not expect to see them, since the other scabbard that I own (Glamdring) has none. IF you never turn the scabbard around you can live without even knowing that the screws are there.

It is small as the picture shows and I found it easy to roll, pack in the bag and cinch up.  All I did was fold the bag in half and rolled from the toe to the head of the bag, making sure to roll it small and straight.  The Cinch sack is slightly tight but it needs to be in order to keep the bad smaller.  I was able to go from being in the bag to having it cinched up in less than 3 minutes.  I think the buckles are fine but keep in mind to pull straight down on the straps and I'd slowly pull down the straps, alternating straps, using two at a time on the opposite site to get an even cinching without too much strain on the straps.  I've done this process 8 times now and have had no problems of consequence.  I am very cold natured so I personally wouldn't use the bag below 45 but that is me.

P.S.

If you are new to camping, keep in mind most temp ratings are based on you being in a tent, on a pad of some kind and you wearing some clothing."

- It's extremely light and compact, which makes it easy to carry around.

- It's convenient that it attaches to my keys, especially since I always have them out when I exit a building. I don't have to remember to take it because it's on the key chain.

- The pink color makes it easy to spot in my bag so I can grab it quickly.

- It's extremely simple to use.

-  I see that another reviewer said that it's easy to discharge this in your purse. I haven't found that to be the case. I think it would be very difficult to do by accident and I haven't done that so far though I take it everywhere.

- Because it's a small hot pink object, it's not going to look very intimidating, which could be a negative. On the other hand, you'll have the element of surprise on your side because it doesn't look threatening.

I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because  I see consistent reviews stating that the spray itself does not go a full 8 feet away as the directions state, and that it's a mist rather than a strong spray so it's just as likely to hit you as the attacker. As I said, I haven't sprayed it, but if a lot of people say this same thing, it's important to take that into account. Lastly, I feel that it looks rather phallic, and I find that a bit embarrassing to carry around."

Works well out to 100 yards but that is about the limit.  I have a little problem with 22's but no problem with 30 cal. The image gets a little dim a full magnification but it is still fine for scoring.  One guy at the range looked through it and said he could not make out any of the holes.  That may have been an individual problem.  The comment others have made about it being hard to focus is true.  You have to push down on the focus control and it takes quite of bit of force to turn the wheel,  it throws the aiming off, but once it done its done.  That could have been a little better thought out.  There is no color fringing that I can see. That will probably change if you put an uncoated eyepiece on it.  I love the compact length. The table tripod that comes with the scope a little shaky but it is good enough for the range.

Bottomline, this a good, cost effective spotting scope for the rifle range. At $85 it is probably about the cheapest 100yd range spotter you will find."

The frame is definitely steel not aluminum, and also the training wheels could be much better. They are really cheaply made training wheels that come loose very easily.  I remember as a kid having a diamond back as my first bike and can say that the newer diamond backs are not as well made as they used to be.

I mean, it is just a little red dot!  Well, I have it mounted to a Smith & Wesson M&P Performance Center C.O.R.E. in 9mm.  The improvement over the iron sights is nothing short of amazing.  It was easy to install, needed very little adjustment and greatly improved my speed to acquire and hit a target.

Yep, I would highly recommend this to anyone needing a good sight system.  It is the battery model with NO adjustment for red dot intensity.  Adjustment isn't really needed as it self adjust for the light condition you are currently in.  This happens without any input from you.  Going from a low light to bright light works great."

I have a longboard to commute to/from classes in my University, and to/from work and back to my apartment.

My main requirements for bearings:
-Smooth
-Quiet (although I could honestly care less)
-Don't require me to kick every second

I've had these for about a year before repurchasing these.
I'll be honest, I'm horrible to my bearings.
I've ridden in puddles up to 3"" tall (yes, I barely got through), submerged these guys, and the damn things still worked great.
I've read somewhere that the average lifespan for bearings is about a year daily use, or a little more if not used that often.
I can tell you this: I use my board daily.

It's lasted me during the California summer rain storms, because I could care less about walking through puddles- so I skated through them.
These guys, kept going.
About a year later, they still roll like crazy, but not the same as when new.
Used some alcohol, soap, and dried them out- and they roll great again. Put them in an old board and passed it down the family.

I do have the Super Reds, and honestly, I don't feel that much of a difference.
Maybe it's because it's on a normal board w/ gummy wheels, but either way I feel like the Reds are the best buy for the price.

Would definitely recommend these, and probably will end up buying two or three more sets before I graduate college.

Let me start by admitting that I purchased this one on a whim.  I found it as a Gold Box deal for under $20.  I couldn't pass it up and thought I would use it as a gift for one of my elder sons.  After it arrived and I took some time to look it over, it found its way to my pocket where you can find it most days.

Others have written comparisons to other models, and have highlighted specific tools.  I'll try to add a few things that helped make this one of my favorite knives.

 - Right off the bat, there's no beating the style of can-opener that you'll find on this and every other Victorinox Swiss Army Knife.  I've used both types (on Wegner and Victorinox models) and this one wins, hands down.

 - I wear eyeglasses, and the mini screwdriver that is nested in the corkscrew is perfect for tightening up the screws on my glasses.  You can either use it separately, in your fingers, or you can flip it over and thread the blunt (handle) end back into the corkscrew, allowing you to use the full knife as a handle. That simply makes it easier to use.

 - I don't use the hook for carrying tied packages, but find it invaluable for removing hot pots from over a fire.  No more burnt fingers from the water pot for me!

 - I like having both the larger and smaller cutting blades, especially for whittling.

 - The scissors are larger than those on the Classic (I have one on my key ring), so I find them easier to use, especially for cutting fabric or larger sections of paper (like coupons from the in-store flier).

 - The number of screwdriver tips makes this knife a wonderful tool to have on-hand for quick tinkering.  The phillips head is suprisingly versatile.  I was able to use it on extremely small wood screws, and it works very well on computer case and mounting screws (I'm a techie by trade, and love having this one with me at the office).

 - The one feature I thought I would never use, the ballpoint pen, actually came in quite useful a few days after pocketing this knife. I was at a product launch meeting and I didn't have a pen (I had counted on the vendor giving away logo pens, but they ran out).  The pen nests into the same groove as the hook (albeit at the opposite end), making for a suprisingly comfortable and easy-to-use writing instrument.

 - Finally, since I've been wilderness camping for more than 25 years, I like having the magnifying glass as a good weather fire-starter.

This is the knife that sits in my pocket most days of the week.  I also take it on all of my weekend camping trips and hikes.  I do like some other knives for other occasions (I prefer, for example, my Centurian {also by Victorinox} when I'm canoeing in the BWCA since I can use the longer {4""} blade to fillet fish and since I like the thinner profile stuffed into my pocket while sitting in the canoe). This is a fantastic, all-around knife.  You can't go wrong for the price (even if $60).  It's well-worth it and bound to become a favorite."

More of an earthy, greenish/brown color with coyote colored molle and trim. Nice.  So far, all the 5.11 stuff I've purchased I have been very happy with.  Pricey, but I've tried getting by with the cheaper ""economy"" gear you can get elsewhere, (that often times is an exact copy)  but I found that you'll be tossing that stuff in the garbage can in short order as it falls apart pretty quickly if you actually use it.  It might look like it, but appearance is where it ends. Finally dropped the cash on a quality piece of gear and I could immediately tell the difference when I received it, and I'm sure this will hold up for years and years. I highly recommend this backpack.  It's a keeper.

So I took it to lunch with me and afterwards I showed it to everyone.  After everyone else had left the dining room, we spaced two chairs about 20 feet apart.  We each took turns.  Now, I don't want to imply we were experts at this but I was amazed at how well we did do.  We had people cheering for either end of the 20 ft.

This is not difficult at all.  I can see where young children would really get a kick out of it. One of the residents that lives here said she wished she had one as she was going to be taking care of her two grandsons for a couple of days.  So, I loaned it to her.  She called me today and said it was really keeping them occupied and they loved it.  Now you know opinions from both ends of the age spectrum.

The master link is a solid attachment and very very unlikely to fail.  It does require a special too to remove it and another one to connect it.  The ""new"" design is even more unlikely to come apart and has a bit of spring in it. In order to remove or install--- it helps to compress the link on assembly or dissasembly  even with the special tool..

 Here's how to remove and install with no special tools. First, inspect the supplied new link to get an idea of how it works..

To remove:  get a small vice grips or hemostat and lightly compress the two side of the link together, letting  the tool hang from
 the chain.  Then put small screwdrivers  thru the links on either side of the master.  Now hold the tops of the screwdrivers parallel while squeezing the  screwdriver shafts together with another vice grip or pliers just above where the blades enter the links.  The master will compress and can be removed.

To install:  cut to size and thread the new chain thru the derailler, chain ring and cogs. Pull the ends together and install the master link parts on either side.  Reapply the vice grips to the two sides of the link.  Get on the bike apply the rear brake and stand on a pedal to stress the chain.

Much easier to do than to describe.

Remove the tool, lube the chain,  readjust the deraillers and go for a RIDE!"

Not complicated, but must have proper clearance.  I modified the base/rest by sanding sides in a bit to allow vanes with pitch to clear (I use small diameter arrows).  Also, I found that as base wears (takes a lot of shooting), arrow will become lower in relation to upper brushes.  Simple adjustment of base post solved that.  According to NAP, if one brush wears more, move arrow TOWARD wearing brush.  Not in all cases, but was the case for me.  The only time that I encountered a problem with the base breaking was when I let someone else shoot my bow and they nocked the arrow UPSIDE DOWN!  Have replaced brushes (a bit pricey, but compared to other very expensive rests, acceptable) twice in two years. Have not had to replace original post, yet.  Kit comes with brushes and new post (good to have on hand out in the field...just in case) as well as replacement felt that goes on top of lower base for noise reduction ( I don't use it).  This rest is outstanding for straight-fletched arrows, in my opinion.  I will continue to use this product."

How can you tell? Try using a magnet. Just be aware that there are many of the 'older' models languishing on shelves and in warehouses, and you are not assured of getting a newer one unless you order it directly from Katadyn and specifically request the brass model. It is entirely possible that the newer model has remedied the initial failings of this model (there was an extensive recall of stoves and repair kits using parts in common with this stove over the last year).

ORIGINAL, 'RESCUED' REVIEW FOLLOWS

For some reason, all the other reviews of this stove seem to have disappeared from Amazon's site. However, extracted from the Web cache is my original review, somewhat edited - i purchased at least one of these stoves from Amazon in 2009:

This is the latest (and perhaps last) incarnation of the Optimus line of 11, 111, 111B, 111T, and 111C stoves, now officially designated the T88. Unfortunately, in the transition from the brass tank versions of the 111, and starting with the 111C (first model to switch to a steel fuel tank), the stove has gone down in performance and quality.

Here's a bit of info that may help you after purchasing this stove: Open the fuel tank cap and use a bright light to look inside the tank. You will find quite a bit of metal and flux debris (flakes) scattered inside from the manufacturing process. Use some fuel or denatured alcohol and repeatedly flush the tank, straining each time. When the tank rinses clean, you should be good to go on using the stove. You may also want to unscrew, remove, spread, oil and reinstall the pump leather to ensure pressurization. If you do not flush the tank before use, you WILL have a clogged filter to deal with. I also found debris between the filter and the jet, requiring a simple removal of the spindle and jet, then blowing out with compressed air. Invest in a repair kit for this stove!

The person or persons in charge of this stove's manufacturing and marketing must be having a bit too much akvavit with smoked fish for lunch, and corporate badly needs to do some personnel house-cleaning before the good name of a 100+ year-old brand is destroyed. In fact, he, she, or they need to sit down and write personal letters of apology to all existing Optimus stove owners - but there won't be any way to do this, as there's no warranty registration!

Further evidence supporting a corporate spanking is in the very name of the stove: THIS IS NOT A STOVE FOR HIKING AS IT IS A TANK! THIS IS A BASE CAMP STOVE - REPEAT - A STOVE FOR BASE CAMP USE. Also, multiple different images of the Hiker Plus are spread throughout the Internet on various vendor Web sites. Will you get a stove with a black tank and green fittings? Nope. Will you get a stove with a Optimus lime green tank and brass fittings? Not entirely.

Minus one star due to poor consumer communication and marketing.

The stove I received came in a new, but worn box. The outside image of the stove showed a silver-colored (aluminum) case for the stove. Inside however, revealed a heavy, black steel case with poorly pop-riveted hinges (which I will have to no doubt eventually replace). The tank is lime green, the large plastic knob for the flame control is lime green, and the gas tube from the tank - even the nut attaching to the vaporizing tube is painted lime green! The nut had obviously been previously tightened with undue care, as there are mashed marks underneath the paint on the nut - possibly to hide poor assembly?

Needless to say, my heart sank when I examined the stove out of the box - this unit does not feature the quality machining and brass fittings of the SVEA 123R. The knurling on the pump and fill knobs is of crude Third-World manufacture. Welcome to the global economy.

Minus another star due to lack of quality control, inspection, or testing.

This is a Nova Plus stove head retro-fitted into the 111-series box with a 111C steel tank. The quality of the Nova head is good, leading me to believe that this product is a hybrid of out-sourcing and out-sourced assembly of manufactured parts.

I ordered my unit from amazon. Unfortunately, the stove was non-functional right away due to poor quality control in post-assembly or [non-]testing: The stove would not pressurize via the pump because of a mis-installed pump leather with a small crease. There was *no way* this stove could have been fired up in a factory testing situation.

Now I'm not some namby-pamby pantywaist who's going to get his knickers all in a twist over a small problem like that (I was more worried about gas leaks or a clogged line). So I simply removed the pump plunger, uncreased the leather and carefully re-installed. After filling with new naptha, the stove pressurized.

Minus a third star because I had to fix something that should have worked right away.

The firing test proceeded with no problem. With pressure in the tank, I simply released a small bit of fuel into the Nova Plus's cup and small wad of fiberglass, lit the head, allowed it to heat up, then cracked open the valve a bit. Good initial pattern, and after a minute, a nice blue controllable flame.

You can do a fast boil or a slow simmer with this stove. It can use nearly any fuel except for No. 2 heating oil, bunker crude, or alcohol. It has a unique magnetic cleaning needle, actuated by flipping the stove tank and back forwards and back on the case's track. The stove is a tank, and once functioning should work for a lifetime, barring abuse. It is the only type of its kind on the market, and is perfect for car camping or emergencies. An inexpensive replacement kit of parts is available. These are the reasons I'm keeping the stove, despite its initial and other failings.

My suggestions for improvements:

1. Get the product kinks out first, then standardize marketing.
2. Get a handle on QC.
3. Drop the cheap steel case and use anodized aluminum.
4. Make a user-installable alcohol jet available.
5. Provide a 'quiet' burn burner cap (similar to earlier 111 models)
6. Encourage warranty registration for feedback.

BTW, I also ended up having to extract the non-return valve (NRV), located at the bottom of the fuel pump tube. This is easy, using either a standard NRV removal tool or a screwdriver. Be careful! Do not strip the soft brass head of the NRV. If you find that your pump rod extends or remains in an extended position while using the stove, you may have a dangerous situation! Either use kerosene from greater safety, or extract the NRV and service it for proper operation (it prevents fuel from pushing back out of the tank via the pump tube). You can stretch the NRV spring slightly, check the o-ring seal or replace the entire unit from a Hiker Plus repair kit."

It fits well around me and I honestly forget I'm wearing it; I only remember when I'm getting ready to take a shower and see it. It reads your heart rate accurately and does not ""fail"" like others do. I have had other chest monitors and at times, the connection will drop or stop reading; this one, I get the sensor a little wet and it's never failed. Another great feature that I randomly stumbled across was when I was running on the treadmill at the gym (Lift Fitness Treadmill), the Polar devices sync to the heart rate monitor on the treadmill so you don't have to keep looking at your phone. This was great to see; I was confused at first since I was not holding onto the hand bars, but I compared the heart rate monitor on my phone and the one synced to the treadmill and it was spot on.

There's just a few things that Bushnell could do to make this a great system.  Mainly number one listed below.  The rest come from special cases (hog trap and low signal).

1. the android app doesn't allow zooming the images, totally ridiculous. app reviews show this is over a year unanswered by Bushnell.
2. no way to turn the GPS off.  why waste my battery when I know where the camera is. This is very important when cell signal is minimal and already using battery..
3. not sure why but we have noticed the camera will not send pictures until it performs the daily check in after being turned off.
4. no way to see current signal to be able to locate a better place for camera.  We used an AT&T cell phone to find a tree with better signal quality.
5. max delay is 60 minutes.  If I have the camera on a hog trap then I only need one image a day.  Given that my cam is in poor cell range I've used the batteries in a month since the coons are regular visitors.  Also, I want an option to only see the last image taken, don't use the battery sending all the images since last transmission."

I lost 2 or 3 in the water shortly after setting the hook, and one bass threw the hook easily on a small jump -- and these weren't big fish. I went back to more conventional jigs that I know and trust and didn't lose any more fish.

I might give them a try again, but probably not. Maybe for ice fishing. I'll stick with the ants, ice jigs and small jigs that I know work."

I understand that there must be a safety feature on it, otherwise the stun gun might go off in a holster or pocket, however, it could have been better designed. Even having to turn the head of the flashlight clockwise or counterclockwise by a quarter turn would have been better. Brightness is pretty good considering the price, it delivers a bright 450 of 500 lumen output. Like most people out there, I couldn't help dry firing it in the air, several times, throughout the time since I bought it to the present, and it has not affected or damaged the flashlight in any way possible. It also has a very long battery life considering how much I use it as well to. I'm still on the first charge. I've dropped it several times, and so far, lenses not cracked, prongs didn't bend or fly off. It seems like a really sturdy flashlight considering. I ordered a second one for my fiance to use when she does her standing guard accounts. It sure does help drive away the perverts for sure. For the price, I would definitely buy again if need be, just a better safery design would have been better than the bottom of the flashlight, in case you need the stun gun out fast in a hostile situation"

Feels durable enough. The only thing I noticed is the stitching could be better. They went all the way with material and zippers and then wheres the thread? I don't know if the thread is too small or just not enough, but then again I am not a thread expert.

Another note, this bottle has been dropped a handful of times and still has not broken. My previous bottle had broken when dropped and had to be replaced (all before I found this Camelbak). I have found that recently my bottle will leak a little bit when sitting upright (pressure inside?), but for me this isn't a deal breaker as I only have water in the bottle and the bottle has too many other pros. :)"

It's a pain to adjust between different sized rifles but it does work well once it is properly fitted.

also, it seems to do well if your bench rest shooting ie; target bench rest etc.
I don't use it at the range, I made  a small screen frame with an onion bag neet for public Gun range use so as to eliminate the adjustment time etc.
I do not use this in any kind of run and gun training as movent affects postioning which causes ejection hangups = pain in the Butt and lost time. Hence the 4 stars"

The frames are slightly too small for my face (which isn't really a knockout feature for me) and the color isn't masculine enough.  (My kids tease me for wearing ""chick glasses"".)  Having said that, they're still great glasses and I'll wear them when my daughters aren't around.  :)

Aside from that, THESE GLASSES ARE AMAZING.  I can't believe how much you get for such a reasonable price.

Included:

* A nice hard-shell zippered case.
* Sturdy rims (even if they aren't macho enough for my kids' dad).
* Soft cleaning cloth
* FIVE SETS OF LENSES!!!!
* A groovy carrier for the four spare sets of lenses. The carrier sticks to to the inside of the case with Velcro. It's kind of cool yet creepy how spare lenses squint out at you from the carrier.

I'm pretty rough on glasses, so having five sets of lenses is amazing.  They even come with clear lenses if you just need basic eye protection (see the warning below about the protection though).

The lenses are notched to allow your forehead to breath.  That's great for me, because I tend to sweat a lot and fog up my glasses.  I haven't fogged these up yet.  However, the notches leave a small amount of room where bugs or road debris could get through and compromise the eye protection.

I guess I have one more minor gripe.  I wish the packaging had included instructions for swapping the lenses.  It's not super obvious how you do it, so check their website if you get stuck.  They included SO MUCH with this product; it would have been great if they'd gone one step further and included product documentation.

Other than these few small gripes, I'm EXTREMELY IMPRESSED with these glasses."

These things are ridiculously small. My wife, who wears women's size 7 shoes, can't get these on her foot.

There wasn't much I could find at the local stores that appeared ""manly"" enough for a regular dude; it was all too fancy for me. So I thought to myself, who would make a simplistic pouch that is just carrying what I need? 5.11! I wear a bunch of their gear and work and we use their jump bags, so I just looked up ""5.11 pouches"" on a whim and found this.
Works great for a personal med pouch. It has plenty of room for lots of average size bottles. I use one side of mine to carry my Rx drugs and allergy med I take daily. The other side houses a large bottle of Excedrine, Afrin, Blistex, Vicks, Benadryl, effervescent tabs, Q-tips, and floss picks (all just in case because you never know what a day in EMS will throw at you). The zippers run smoothly. The mesh on the inside makes it easy to identify where you've placed everything.
If I were a tactical medic, I'm sure this would work great for IVs, dressing, TKs, and all that. I can imagine where I'd store it all. But for now I'm extremely happy with it's size and how easily I can tuck it away in my bag. Plus I'm pretty sure 5.11 only makes awesome stuff. So that in itself is a pretty solid reason to pick this up."

But for those coffee shop riders, casual errand runners, etc, it's a good lock. The 10mm cable is plenty thick, the lock is beefy, and the combo is easily changed to whatever you desire when the lock is open. It comes with a mounting bracket if you're inclined to mount it to the bike (has to mount to a circular tube only), so you have a plethora of options as to where to store it on your bike. For now I have it wrapped around my seatpost, as I only ride with it when I'm headed to get coffee or something. I lock mine and my girlfriend's bikes up with it, seems to do the job well.

I was super happy with my putting, no single 3 putt. This grip is slim yet right size. It helps tremendously to keep short putts on line and retain feel for long lag putts. The distance control with feel is great and helps to keep on line with alignment. Putting is about alignment and distance. I found both and the results speak for themselves.

These converters are great and beats drilling, not to mention tricking that Presta hating floor pump into working well again."

Regarding performance, I see no perceivable increase in distance.  In windy conditions the ball has a difficult time staying on it.  It is hard to drive the tee into the hard winter ground.

Its nice that the batteries are replaceable, which you can find at almost any store like walmart or target.

I read the reviews on several sets that seem adequate, but settled on this one as the others all seem to have some drawbacks. I am very happy that I did. Let me say that although I am a not an expert repairman, I can usually figure things out and leave the project better off than I found it. The overall quality of this tool set seems very satisfactory for the novice repairman. I have used it upgrade my pedals, replace my seat and replace my front hub bearings and cone. The tools in this set worked fine. I would HIGHLY recommend this set to a novice repairman shopping for a set of tools on a budget Thank you.

I am updating my review of this product to reflect additional usage. I needed to remove and replace the freewheel on an older Schwinn bike. The Park Tool Bicycle Repair Blue Book list 7 common freewheel removal tools. This repair kit contains 2 and they seem to be two of the least common tools. Therefore I am downgrading my rating of this product from 5 to 4 stars. Still a good value overall."

They function exactly the same in every way, and even feel the same in my hand.  If my eyes were closed, I'd scarcely be able to tell which pair I were holding.  M100 are classic duty-grade handcuffs, well-respected in the law-enforcement and security industries.

Pros:
-Stainless is the best color of metal, in my opinion.
-No Nickel.  Won't cause allergic reactions for detainees.  Virtually no one is allergic to stainless.
-No Chipping.  Nickel plated finishes can chip if they are scratched, leaving the steel unprotected.  Stainless doesn't.
-No Bluing.  Bluing is a great protectant, but will wear off over time and then need to be reapplied.  Stainless doesn't require protection.
-No Rust.  Blued steel will have surface rusting on edges exposed to water or sweat.  Stainless won't.
-Minimal Service.  Just lube them up a little from time to time to keep them operating smoothly.
-Appropriate for wet environments, and sustained use (because they won't rust and don't need to be serviced).
-Double-lock works as intended.  Normally, handcuffs will be able to tighten even after they are applied.  The double-lock prevents them from tightening any further.  Much more comfortable for the detainee.

Cons:
-Came with a coating of some kind.  Felt like an oxide against my skin.  Came off with some firearms-grade solvents and paper towels.  Would rub off with use.
-Neither brushed nor polished.  They have just a dull, raw-stainless finish from the factory.  You could brush or polish them yourself for extra classiness, but it's unnecessary.
-Classic double lock is harder to engage than a push-button type.  This is both good and bad.

I think these are fantastic."

The ensemble is very reasonably price and well made of nylon exterior fabric with soft, flexible liners and metal clips.  In addition to being inexpensive, the holster fits the firearm well, completely covering the trigger and trigger guard and holding the pistol securely in ordinary use without a retention device.  The mounting clips hold the holster and magazine carrier securely to a 1.5"" belt, as well as to an elasticized waistband.  As I had hoped, they also work well with a Ruger SR9C and a Beretta 9000S.

I have used this ensemble since about Labor Day, 2017.  Although I have not yet tested extended carry with the other firearms, I have found the ensemble comfortable for all day IWB carry of the P99C.  All three firearms draw well from it, though reholstering the 9000S one-handed I have found to be more cumbersome than the other two; and for all three it is somewhat more cumbersome than it would be with a stiff form holster.

If have been sufficiently favorably impressed by the ensemble to order another fitted for Walther PP (also works well with Bersa Thunder .380 and Beretta M84) a few weeks after receiving the P99C fitting components.  Being concerned about service life, I rarely grant a five star rating to any product I have had for less than a year.  If these components continue to serve in good condition for at least a year, then I would grant them a five star rating."

I carry my water bottle EVERYWHERE everyday and use only water. I wash it once or twice a week with soap and water to keep it clean. I really liked this water bottle, until yesterday it was my favorite. The design is pretty good. It's sturdy and the silicone sleeve offers good protection. I like the pop top; it's very convenient to drink from. That being said the silicone part in the lid can come out and leave a large hole. It only came out once, but it seemed like a silly design to have it be removeable since it was kind of annoying to put back in. Not really a big deal though. What was a big deal was that since I use it everyday-all the time it's always nice and moist in there. Some sort of mold started to grow inside the silicone in the lid. There are dark little spots and I am unable to clean it or scrape it off because it's actually growing INSIDE the silicone. I'm not really sure what caused this other than extreme frequent use (because I do clean it!) Either way it went from being my favorite water bottle to one I can no longer use. If you're a person like me who absolutely needs water with them at all times this might not be for you."

The bag is only available in right hand zip, so I can't zip with my wife's and make a big bag that we can both use. That being said the bags will zip together, but the hood will be in someone's face... The fill according to the tag is 75% down and 25% feather. This would be why it is heavier and bulkier than more expensive bags. Overall I think they did a good job on this bag. Be sure to take it out and ""fluff"" it up before use as this will get more air pockets and keep you warmer. I did the down tracker and it claims 695 down from china. I have yet to put the bag on a scale, but something tells me it will be heavier than claimed as it just feels a little heavy."

It was secured with about 3 inches of thread. Not a 3 inch stitch, but literally 3 inches of thread. Maybe enough for 4 or 5 passes through the fabric. All of the other straps are sewn in with a strong sewing machine stitch. This looked like someone didn't fold the strap in far enough for the strong stitch and fixed it just enough so it would hold together long enough to be packed. Another strap has tons of tan threads coming out of the stitched area, but the vest is OD. I'm actually glad it broke in the living room instead of out in the woods. Seriously terrible craftsmanship. The factory in China where this was made must not have a quality control process.

Hopefully the replacement I had to order will be better, but after this, I'm not expecting much.

6-4-11 UPDATE:

I got my replacement vest today. Everything looks like it's properly sewn and put together. It's a very nice vest. It seems like it distributes the weight nicely. I like how the vest fits around the sides. There's plenty of MOLLE space for attaching stuff above your hip. On mine I have a med-pack on one hip and a canteen on the other. Another good feature is that you can expand the vest to probably fit a XXXXL size. So even if you're bulky, you can still adjust it to fit over a jacket. I'm only giving it 4/5 stars because of the terrible first vest that I received."

It looks to me like they tried to back-engineer the ""Ops-Core"" shroud (OSdream even sends the piece with ""Ops-Core"" pacageing material) but somebody in engineering either used a bad micrometer or something went a foul in the casting process because the unit is out of spec. my micrometer tells me the OSdream shroud is .013 of an inch to wide and .037 of an inch to long in the opening where any mounting plate has to go. So whatever piece of gear it stick in the shroud it will slop around like water in a wagon. Not the kind of fit you want to put gear you spent a hefty chunk of your hard earned money to get. As for this item, it has no reliable functional use and is not worth the time and trouble to send back. I have ordered the more expensive shroud. Yes it is thee times more expensive, but since military and law enforcment procurement departments tend to have zero tollerence for out of spec poor quality control gear I am confident it will work the way it is supposed to, and if it doesn't, I've got a company I can actually CALL and get at least answers if not a remedy without going through forms, emails and all the delays and impediments these firewalls appear to be designed to provide."

Lowered the review by 1 star since

a) I have come to disklike the smallness of the catch whith which the BB's are fed in from the lower hole, it hurts my nail and often springs free, scattering the BB's being loaded. its not a big gripe, but a larger catch would be nice.

and

 B) both mags I had failed in the same way- the valve that you tighten the CO2 powerlett into (via the allen wrench screw on the base of the mag)wbroke on both.
1st 1 began with a slow leak, it was control able by using a more then liberal drop of pelgun oil directly into this valve and into the square top opening (where the gas exits I guess)and extra tightening, which led eventually to the lower valve breaking and dropping out.
2nd mag had no issues, and was NOT over tightened like the one mentioned above... one day the powerlett basicly stuck and when I pulled it free the valve dropped out with the powerlett.

Now, while I might just be clutzy and rough both failures happened in the same place, something to be aware of with this rather pricy , though in other ways well built mag. I did put about 70 to 80 powerletts through the mags, which at about 45/50 good shots is fairly heavy use.

All in all they are still pretty nice mags, as evidenced that I intend to by another in order to keep shooting the excellent BB gun for which its made."

The shape of Terry saddles (they have an entire range) and the slot are ingenious. I use mtn bike saddles on my 'cross bikes, but the flat top of the Terry is better for long rides, 80+ miles.

The only downsides are that it does not hold the weapon very close to the body unless fitted to a pistol belt, and the retention strap prevents the safety from being engaged on Taurus 92/99 series pistols.

I never owned a Redfield before Leupold bought them. I picked up the 4-12x40 for a CZ 455 for long range bullseye matches and have been extremely happy with my purchase. Once I found out that Leupold was making a scope under the Redfield name I started looking at the many reviews of the product line online. I didn't find a single poor review so I purchased one to see for myself. The scope is excellent and everything said about them I've found to be true. Very well made, the optics are excellent and compare to scopes costing twice as much. I'm purchasing another one for a Ruger American 243, this scope matches the price point for that rifle extremely well and will give me a very tough and reliable scope/rifle for the up coming season as well as for coyote's

Side by side with a Leupold Vari-X III, mine, it's hard to see a difference in the optics or clarity. The Redfield appears superior to Nikon, also mine, at the same price point and greatly superior to Bushnell, Simmons, which I don't own but have looked at numerous times for comparison purposes.

If they keep this level of quality and value I'll be a ""Redfield guy"" for years to come."

If you carry the top part of weapon protrudes outwards. Look at photos.  I use another holster which sticks it to the body.  For when I really need to hide my weapon I go with IWB type. It a pain but hides much better

For out on the RANGE I love this holster.  It looks cool and much easier to draw from cause it sways away from your body

Last 2 pictures are from a different holster. I'm not here to say what brand or dogging this one. Just saying if you plan on a carry holster you need to know.

Everyone knows I have something under my shirt with this holster"

No problems at all with water any of the 4 or 5 days that it had rained. I did treat all seams on the tent when I received it with silicone water proofing like I do all of our tents.

The tent is incredibly easy to put up. Just unfold the legs, make sure a the roof clips are on the poles and up it goes. Its easy enough for a single person to put up without issue. And I was able to have the 6yr old help.

The only con (which I knew when buying the tent) is that the D-door does not have a rod in it to make it rigid. If there was anything I could say that would really improve this tent it would be to make the D-Door rigid like some other cabin style tents."

These Camping Pads are Awesome!,"As my wife and I set off on an adventure of a lifetime, hiking and camping through Arizona desert and mountain regions, we needed good sleeping pads that were comfortable and lightweight. The Ultralight Series has worked great! We've been camping for the last couple of weeks on hard, rocky, surfaces in the deserts and mountains, and even the lightweight has proven to be very comfortable and durable. I can't even tell I'm sleeping on the ground. Even though I was not looking for the insulation value on this product (that's why I purchased the lightweight for backpacking not comfort or warmth value) it made a huge difference in the cool desert evenings.

When we first unpacked these before use, we allowed the foam to expand and the mattress to naturally fill with air for a few hours while we set up camp. Once we were ready for bed we only needed a good, solid breath or two to fill the sleeping pads up, and next thing you know, we were sleeping in comfort.

 I'm 6'5"" and 205lbs and is this product has worked great. I highly recommend Fox Outfitters sleeping pads! Happy camping!"

As other people have noted, these are not specifically contoured to be left or right legged.  So, they fit pretty flat against the shin.  If you're someone that has bigger legs, you really need to keep looking... because these would pretty much be like pasties for your shins.

I've tried playing with them for three games thinking that there needed to be a break-in/adjustment period.  However, after three games, I'm going back to my old shin guards until I can find something else.

If you do go this route because you can't pass up the ""add-on"" price of 8 bucks (which is what I did even though I read about the lack of contour and should have known), make sure you get a size larger than your normally would.  I saw that in someone else' review and am very glad I took their advice. They are definitely smaller."

Since then, I've swam for 20-40 minutes about three times per week in both a saltwater pool and the ocean. I always rinse them in cold water after and hang them to dry. They do come in contact with chlorine when I wear them in the jacuzzi at my gym, but they haven't aged much at all. The only sign of wear is the seams are a little fuzzy (maybe from rubbing on my drag suit I wear over them). Hardly noticeable though. I've gained about 15lbs since I bought them and I'd say the leg holes are a little tighter as a result.

Highly recommend."

The idea was that this would be the light sitting atop the bench as I set up the generator/battery to get the main auxiliary lighting up. What I wanted was LED lighting for maximum battery life and bulb shock-protection, take a common battery, be rugged, and have variable output. I've some other Streamlight illumination products and have been pretty happy with them so I figured I'd take a shot at this thing. It meets the rather siple criteria I had, and Im pleased with it. It has a generous amount of rubber 'bumpers' on it and when it sailed off the top of my truck (oops) it just bounced off the concrete with nary a scratch. Points for ruggedness. It lights up a small room well enough to let you get your gear together and see what you're doing. There are several attachment points for hanging the lamp in a variety ways, all of which can be useful although I usually just set it on a tall object and leave it there to light the whole room. In short, its a good, solid, rugged, lamp suited for indoor use. I'm sure it works just as well outdoors but its a bit bulkier than I'd want to haul around in a pack. But, as an emergency light for the basement or garage or wherever you keep your emergency gear it is just about ideal."

6225,1989,Male,80000,590.467362,No,Yes,Northeast,NH,4,"11 30, 2009","Decent quality pick-resistant lock, but key stuck a bit in keyway until it was worn in","This is a decent quality disc padlock, and according to the Kryptonite website it has a five-pin cylinder - which is more pick-resistant than the similar-looking, less-expensive four-pin disc locks from other makers  It also is a little heavier than the cheaper disc locks and has a better finish, indicating better quality to me.

This lock will deter an unskilled thief trying to smash or pry it open, but it *can* be picked by an expert with plenty of time, or cut off with heavy-duty, noisy power tools (that's how fire fighters cut open anything to get inside). Note that the weak link is usually the hasp that the lock is connected to, which is often cut or pryed off by thieves. However this lock is much better than the old-style laminated steel or brass padlocks, which can be defeated in a couple of other ways  too.

The next step up in security rom this lock would be the Abus brand ""Diskus"" locks which look similar, but cost a little more.  They also come in larger an smaller diameter sizes.  However, Abus has many models of Diskus locks with different features, so chosing the right one is confusing.  And their website isn't cleear on all the differences.  Some Diskus locks use special keys that can only be copied at a locksmith or obtained from an Abus dealer. Amazon carries some of these lock, but I would suggest first downloading the Abus catalog at Abus.com, or buying from a locksmith who can help in choosing the features you want.

As far as better cut resistance (from power toools) , another possibilty would be one of the much heavier ""shrouded shackle"" padlocks (both American Lock and Brinks have them on Amazon for $22-$30).  They look like small bricks, with the shackle covered on both sides - they are also either  5-pin or 6-pin for pick resistance . However, these may not fit through all hasps, so best to check the  dimensions on the manufacturer's websites. (American makes a couple of sizes in this type of lock.) If you need better security than those or the Abus Diskus, there are more expensive padlocks (some on Amazon) that are harder to pick or cut.  Abus and Medeco make them.  You also have to check if they will fit through your hasp, because the side shroud over the shackle can interfere. Again, it can be worth it to go to a locksmith for these. Like I wrote though, the hasp (or what it is mounted to) is usually the weak link, so there is not point buying an expensive lock if the hasp is thinner or weaker than the lock (like on most  storage lockers or sheds).  The companies make high security hardened hasps (which cover the mounting bolt heads), but even those may be easier to cut through with power tools than the Kryptonite lock.

By the way, Initially the key stuck a bit  in the Kryptonite lock keyway when I tried to pull it out. I bought two locks and both had the same problem. I had to jiggle the key around for a second or so to get it unstuck.  With some spray lubricant, after many openings and closings of the locks in regular use, the sticking has stopped.  Apparently there were some rough edges inside the keyways on my locks that eventually wore down, and now they are fine, but this seems like a quality-control problem.  Another reviewer mentioned some sticking too. But it might have just been one batch of locks.  I would still buy the locks again though, since  they are better than the other disc locks I've seen at the hardware stores."

It is the same knife only the blade is twice as thick and they sell it here on amazon for 60 bucks.  It is a more substantial knife and the blade is much more substantial.

This is the best edc because of the steel, construction, and the thumb push.  This is probably the least popular config out of all the other delica 4 config's because of the flat ground blade, but whichever config you choose these are great knives.  The blade under 3 inches and under 3 ounces is simply what you want in your pocket, the vg10 is a steel that once you buy it you never want anything else, and Spyderco makes some of the best knives anywhere.  I have this one and the 100% stainless serrated delica 4.  I suggest you buy them both, but this one is better for every day carry because of the weight.  Yes, the blade is very thin in comparison to other models like zt or even the serrated version of the same knife, but that is what plays into this knife being so unassuming but yet sharp as a scalpel.  I put the blade thickness in the medium category, there are thinner ones out there.  This knife is truly a wolf in sheep's clothing, think this is a sheep and this sheep will cut your head off if you need it.  The thumb push would give you the thrust of a dagger, but daggers are illegal almost everywhere to carry.  FRN is great as well. Leek and benchmade are fine knives, but the delica 4 is the best IMO, and you cannot touch this quality for 50 bucks.  My first police model spyderco I bought around 30 years ago, still is like brand new except for a couple scratches.  Nothing like vg10!!  This size is better then the police, very unassuming.

Simply my favorite folding pocket knife ever.

The serrated stainless version of this knife is totally different then this config.  It is heavier but also the blade is thicker from tip to back.  If I had to choose only one knife, the stainless 100% serrated version would be my choice, for a lighter friendlier carry option this would be my knife.  They are really two completely different knives, and the serrated one has better construction all the way around and much thicker blade, but it comes at a price both money wise and weight wise. The stainless serrated delica 4 is the knife of a lifetime, it will last forever in adult hands.  This version is still very good for what it is, but it is much less knife.

It fits the gun like a glove. It allows for easy reholster, and it hugs the side of my body so it's ultra comfortable and actually conceals the weapon better than ALL of the IWB holsters that I own.

Not sure about the one slightly negative review. As long as you follow the break-in instructions, this holster fits the SR9c perfectly. I'll be looking to Winthrop for a holster or two for my LCP next. These are serious price performers!"

As for Proofide, I can't honestly say if some other leather dressing wouldn't work as well but this is (not that surprisingly I guess) what the manufacturer recommends. I've got this much invested in the saddle, I may as well follow their instructions. I'm quite aware of the possibilty that I may be being taken advantage of. I decided to attach a photo because even though the description clearly states 25g, I was a little surprised when the tin arrived. The word ""Tub"" just has a certain connotation for me so I felt a little silly that the vague concept of a ""Tub"" meant more to me than the precise measure of ""25 grams"" when I was reading the description. Kind of like ""Jumbo Shrimp"". Gram for gram, Proofhide is more expensive than Sterling Silver. The good news is, it's cheaper than Meth."

As per the descripion they are white and they are made by Adidas but after that...either I didn't read the description correctly or what I got wasn't what I expected. No pockets, no liner, and they're snug. Also, they fit more as if one had ordered a form of stretchy underwear rather than shorts. You cannot wear any colour but white underwear-well, you can but the fabric is so thin that it will be noticed. However I did get what I ordered and wanted; a pair of white shorts. That I have virtually no use for them is largely my fault but in looking at the illustration and reading the description, there's nothing to indicate one isn't getting an all purpose short. I do understand that by labeling them ""striker"" this meant they were designed with soccer playing in mind but still...I'm less than satisfied.

I'm new to tactical rigs and went off many great reviews - but upon arrival at my tactical class, the instructors shared some horror stories about the rigs in the field and how many police departments have forbid the blackhawk style trigger release.

Essentially, the fear that you'll shoot yourself in the foot drawing your weapon because of the trigger catch is a fable -- it's impossible because of the physics involved.  However, you place your trigger finger on the button to release the weapon -- so as you draw your gun, your index finger is already actively depressed and can very easily find its way into the trigger guard as soon as you clear the holster.  Then, in the heat of things, you CAN shoot yourself in the foot -- which I know is a minor detail, but it's more about the act of releasing the weapon instead of the actual trigger release mechanism.

The instructors recommend the style that use a thumb release between your body and the gun, for the draw technique described, you keep your trigger finger in a safe position during the draw."

As far as holding air, I had no problem, however it wasn't used very much.  There is no warranty for this item, so I am stuck; fortunately it was only $60.00 so I can use it as a mattress.  It does sit rather low to the ground so it is tough for this 60 year old to get up.  Also, when in the couch position, the rear is taller than the front, so it feels like you are leaning forward.  I wouldn't replace, nor buy another one or any thing from this company since they offer no warranty.  (One of my pictures is upside down, sorry)"

In the past, I've used throw away goggles or just sunglasses, so I can attest to the downsides to NOT having good goggles: loose fit, obstructed views, fogging lens and glare off the snow.  Aside from being annoying, its downright unsafe when flying down a mountain with your vision impaired.  I was offered a discount on these goggles for my honest feedback and am happy to report then they will solve my woes!

The fit is nice and snug and the headband has a grippy interior so the strap doesn't ride up and off the back of your head.  The lenses are large so you have an unobstructed view and everything looks nice and clear through the lenses.  It comes in a large hard case that's rather bulky, but is for transporting them during travel so they don't get damaged.  There is also a pouch to store them in when you want to tuck them into your (large) pocket or bag at the lodge during lunch.  Also included are instructions and a microfiber cloth for cleaning.

Overall, would recommend!"

I like the adjustability of the vest and the weights.  I ordered the shoulder pads and didn't think I would need them for my short trial but after about 10 minutes I could feel the weight on my shoulders.  Not too bad, but will make sure to put the pads on next time.  I didn't go with full weight and removed 4 of the sandbags so about 16lbs lighter than the full weight.

I ordered the large size of these wading pants and they're about perfect.  If your feet are any bigger than a men's size 12 you'll want to order the extra large.

The inseam length of these is plenty generous, so that when I belt them at my normal pants waist or maybe just a touch higher, there is plenty of extra room in the knees and legs to climb up stream banks and step up onto rocks.  You'd have to be nearly or over 7 feet tall, I believe, before the leg length became an issue with these.

They also have plenty of room to wear extra clothing underneath if you do any cold-weather fishing, and the waist size is more than ample for my 36 inches, and would accommodate someone much larger.  I think the sizing chart on the Frogg Toggs website is accurate for these.

Construction is well done.  I inspected them closely and the only flaw I found was one sewn seam up the back of one leg wasn't quite finished, with about 1/4 inch of the seam not quite sewn all the way up.  This doesn't affect the waterproof capabilities of the pants because those seams are all sealed underneath the outer layer.  The thread-sewn seams must be something they use for access to the different layers when they manufacture these.  This one unfinished, or rather imperfectly finished, seam was the reason for the four stars, otherwise I'd have given them five stars.

Used them for the first time today and purposely went in the water up to about two inches from the belt line and had no leaks whatsoever.  The cold water sure felt good on my legs though, because it was 86 degrees and fairly humid here today.  Walked through a great deal of tall weeds, some thistles, scrubby trees, and some dead branches hidden in the grass.  I also sat down on and slid off of a big boulder.  They show no ill effects from that kind of use.

I usually 'wade wet' in weather like this, wearing just shorts and water shoes, but I wore them today to test them out for an upcoming trip to Colorado where I plan on getting in at least one full day of trout fishing in the Rockies, so I wanted to make sure they weren't going to let me down.  They performed very well and I'm pleased with my choice."

Be sure to put a drop of water in it before painting.  First thoughts are that it won't work when you need it most.  If you have it next to your bed in a drawer, like I do, and you pull it out in the dark, the paint won't be glowing.  You need light to charge them and if you have light then you don't need the glow.  BUT I find they help with target acquisition in any light however no more than if I just used white paint.  This paint is NOT white so I recommend putting some white paint in the areas you are going to want to glow.  I used a Rustoleum flat enamel.  Some people say they use white out with good results.

The first few coats of Glow-on I applied I did not put a drop of water in it ---  a single drop of water is plenty because the bottle is tiny.  It's more than enough paint but the bottle is half the size of your thumb.  Anyhow, the first coats I put on without adding water and it dried lumpy.  The paint is gritty so it when it's not diluted it will lump up.  When I painted I had a black light right next to me so I could see every little spec of the stuff and remove what I didn't want with the over-sized toothpick they give you.  Works great.  I think I over painted some of the rear sights; on a few, if the pistol is pointed at the ground you can see the glow from the top, just a rookie error in painting, I only want the glow to be seen from the rear.  I put it on a Sig 2022 with great results.  A Ruger GP100 with decent results.  Rear sight is great but I painted the front sight too far down.  A Khar CW9 with nice results.  And a RIA compact 1911 with very nice results.  Works great on the front sights that are a small circle like on the Sig and Khar.  Plus those type of sights generally have the white paint already on there to paint over.

I have a tiny little blacklight flashlight that I got here on Amazon.  If I feel I have the time I can point it at the sights for litterally 3-5 seconds and it will glow bright for the time it would take to deal with an intruder.  The black light charges it quick and won't give away you position say if you're in a room.  If I don't have time to use the light or fear the noise of the flashlight button then.. you go at it without the glow.

Truth be told, if I am fairly certain someone is in my house I'm not wasting a second to charge the paint.  And as far as I can tell it's completely useless without some kind of charge.  But with a charge it glows bright for a long time.  I'll probably use it more on emergency flashlights and things like that, even for stars on my daughters ceiling.

As initially stated, interesting stuff.  Good price, and it really glows bright with a charge.  It could be perfect for certain situations but not really for the reason I bought it witch if for home defense at night with little to no light.

Cover with a few coats of clear nail polish overlapping the edge of the Glow-on."

Not only is it an incredible pain to mount on the bike (presuming that you can even find a place for the 9.5 inch lock bar on most bikes), but once you've mounted it, getting the lock in and out of it for a ""quick release"" requires more effort that it might to steal the bike in the first place.

I'd suggest keeping the lock in the bracket and just chaining the bike to the lock---no one will ever get it out of the bracket to release the chain.

Kryptonite should send a written apology and a juice drink to every person who tried to used this bracket. The lock, I like. I can hardly wait for the bracket to break (it's doomed, I can just tell) so that I can carry it in my backpack or design a bracket that makes sense."

I would say that this Throw 'N Stick toy is more on the hit side.  It is incredibly simple, and yet it generates a surprising amount of fun for our family.  We took it outside today on this hot Saturday, and we all played together for quite some time without any problems.  What you get is a very straightforward, run-of-the-mill tennis ball along with two plastic discs, each about the size and shape of a Frisbee.  One side is almost entirely hook-n-lack material (Velcro-like), and the tennis ball sticks to it nicely.  The other side has an adjustable Velcro strap for one's hand.  That's it.  Obviously, two people stand a short distance apart and toss the ball back and forth, catching it on the Velcro disc rather than by hand or in a mitt of some kind.  You catch the ball, pull it off the disc, and toss it back.  Over and over.  That's it.

This is actually very similar to a toy that my brother and I had as children, except it was a mesh Nerf-type ball that we tossed back and forth and caught on much larger plastic mitt devices.  This streamlines that old game and yet does not diminish the fun or re-play-ability.  Franklin's Throw 'N Stick is well made and as simple as it seems.  I first feared that my kids would get bored with this, but never underestimate the attractiveness of outdoor catch - especially catch with a gimmick.  How wonderful to find a good toy that does not require batteries, which encourages outdoor physical activity, and can be enjoyed by the whole family (two people at a time).  All in all, sounds good to me and it's a great value, too.  Recommended."

I'm 5'9 and only weight 150, but I had bruises and tender points all over my hips, back, scapula, etc, basically any area that touched the mattress, would end up sore the next morning. I tried every way of inflation, low, high, medium, etc and nothing would give me a comfortable rest. Maybe I'm expecting this pad to be something it's not, but I was really hoping I wouldn't be more sore from my nights rest than from the mountain biking. Maybe this pad is just meant for a ""get me by"" type of thing rather than a ""sleep well"" type of thing. Suffice to say, this will be my son's and I'll get another one."

Plus the hinge is designed to be more durable. Vortex lacks the little red lever, but really who cares....  Besides, my Butler Creek caps keep breaking off at the hinge.

As another reviewer reminded: measure the *outer* diameter of your scope bells. Know that front and back likely differ in size, even if not quite obvious on your scope.

These fit much, much better than the junky plastic covers from Butler Creek. Gotta love competition!"

We planted green beans, lettuce, and carrots.  I expected insects to be a problem, but I really didn't want to spray chemicals on our garden because that kind of defeated the point of organic, home grown vegetables.  I loved that this product could control insects without coating everything in chemicals.

As soon as I noticed some insect damage on the leaves of the green bean plants, I began spraying then regularly.  I had to spray a ton on for it to keep the insects away, but it did seem to work.  A few weeks later, when I was spraying the green beans, I decided to go ahead and spray the carrots and lettuce too as a preventive measure.  The following day, I went to check on the garden.  The green beans and carrots looked great, but the lettuce had nasty brown spots everywhere the spray had hit it (which was a lot because I had been putting it on heavy).  I'll give it some time to see how it does, but at this point, I'd say the lettuce is ruined.

So, I would recommend this item for some vegetables, but definitely not for lettuce.  I'd actually be hesitant to use it on any plants where you eat the leaves.  Oddly enough, it didn't cause brown spots on either the green beans or carrots."

Get it while you can!!!,"Arrived to me within few days... I was really anxious to get it in person after looking at the 'product-picture' constantly admiring it... Upon opening the package -- I was in love, and probably will never touch another Backpack unless it fails catastrophically and or goes out of stock and manufacturing production... This thing isn't just an @ Backpack -- no!, this an @ ""Wooly Mammoth Elephant"" e.g. hairy, rough, durable, massive in size, and full of mass capacity space with a lot of (pouches) to carry and feed the heard/pack... In my opinion: the way this is designed makes it thee best on the market!!! I'm absolutely in love with it!!! This @ Backpack is now my main 'Combat' and 'Survival/Supply' @ L.R.R.P.C.S(Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol, Combat, and Survival/Supply-Living) Pack -- whether for bug-out S.H.T.F or Revolutionary Guerilla-Insurgent Operations, doesn't matter i.e. dual purpose e.g. survival/defense and combatives/offense... This is one of the largest Backpacks that I've ever seen... There is so many utility pouches that one will find it hard-pressed to use them all in an everyday capacity; but is highly desired for @ camping, hiking and survival etc., needs -- where we need all the space we can get compact as possible into one rig system without having to carry around multiple backpacks as deadweight @ ""Airport Vacation Travel Luggage""... The practical huge size and mass space is highly desired, but also the @ ""design"" of this Backpack is cool from a tactical perspective... The fact this only cost around @ $70 -- was shocking/surprising and well worth every bit of it!!! You'd be hard-pressed to find anything better in quality, design, features and capacity for the price range -- let alone other Backpacks at more expensive prices this good... Likewise: this far beats all my other packs that I've used; and I've been through several dozen 'tactical' Backpacks in my life prior to this from wide-array of brands e.x. Condor, Voodoo, Maxpedition, Rothco, Fox Tactical, 5.11, NcStar etc., and every kind/model and size that you can think of... I've used the old 'Vietnam-era technology' official U.S.G.I @ A.L.I.C.E Lc-1 Packs -- both large and small sizes... I've used various modern Backpacks from @ Maxpedition such as the ""Condor II"" etc... But this Backpack is far by the best of them all in every way!

My views are below:

Size}}} The 56L capacity of the 'main-compartment' is huge and few on the market offer an 56L capacity or more, as most all only offer between 16-40L capacity -- and even then they still don't offer all the excess compartments/pouches that are added onto this pack giving more capacity., plus the mass real-estate of 'P.A.L.S for M.O.L.L.E' sewn-on for additional pouches to increase its capacity carrying size further... The 56L capacity of the 'main-compartment' is large enough for an comfortable relaxing @ ""3 Day [or more!]"" alone individual sustainment; but with the other fixed pouches -- and more add-on pouches -- you can get an stomach-fulfilled rationing @ ""1 Week [or more!]"" alone individual sustainment out of it... In an S.H.T.F survival emergency situation: this pack would be filled up with the (basic materials for critical necessity living, working, fighting, building, wearing, cleaning etc., items) and (critical resources to for life's survival dependent necessities) i.e. water, food, medical supplies, hygiene care, cleaning/disinfectant care, few forks w/ spoons-butter-knives w/ steak-knives, batteries for your equipment, 1-2 pairs of socks, 1-2 pairs of underwear, 1 additional shirt, tent, sleeping-bag, pillow, 1-2 tarps etc-etc-etc., of survival before personal training/survival skill sets in to survive permanently on your own e.g. building home/shelter, make your own clothes, hunting/trapping, water purifying, gathering firewood etc... In an S.H.T.F survival emergency situation: this pack wouldn't be legitimately used for carrying needless material-consumerist things around of no critical value for proficient living survival and fighting sustaining i.e. no computer, laptop, gaming console, stereo, televisions, dvd player etc... The only electronics generally one will be carrying is their @ Handheld Radios, Walkie-Talkie {CB or HAM or GMRS/FRS etc} Communications, Tactical Laser & Flashlight, G.P.S unit, Night Vision Optics, Mobile Phone etc-etc-etc., and that's if any generated electricity or batteries will be available after expending the power to your devices without having personal @ ""solar chargers"" and-or ""generators"" to use them again and reuse them over... And the only clothes that one would be carrying with them are those on their Backs e.x. BDUs [in my case!] etc., which will be washed and re-worn through running 'non-stagnant' riverbed-streams with a bar of soap [and that is depending on variables in play at the time as well!] etc... Generally if one utilizes the given @ 'P.A.L.S for M.O.L.L.E' Tabs with additional pouches and also organizes the pack to its maximum load i.e. pinch and squeeze every inch out of it etc., one can maximize the '56L Main-Compartment' for total of @ ""1-week or more"" with the basic critical essentials for bodily survival i.e. food, water and hygiene alone... One would generally want to get a good @ Plate-Carrier, Tactical Vest, Harness, Chest Rig, or A.L.I.C.E Suspender Rig etc., to keep all their @ Ammo, Magazines, Tactical Accessories, Optics, Guns, Knives, Maps etc., separate from taking up critical space and reducing its capacity needed for 'critical {but non-urgent packed-away} survival and living necessity' materials as food, water, hygiene care etc., and or other items... One would generally A) also want to keep their (critical for survival necessity supplies and tools for emergency reliance) i.e. medical-trauma pouches w/ medical supplies and surgical tools etc., separate from the main-compartment [preferably easiest region accessible to you in case of an accident -- as on your @ tactical-vest, plate carrier, side backpack, drop-leg platform!] etc... And B) those also of your (non-urgent critical living supplies and building tools) i.e. shovel, hammer, axe, hatchet, rope etc-etc-etc., separate from the main-compartment of backpack {hence adding other pouches to the pack for these two purposes is smart!} that is needed space for your food, water, clothes, hygiene products etc... If a person owns an @ ""Mobile 5th-Wheel Trailer w/ Truck"" or ""RV"" or ""Truck w/ Camping Tent Trailer"" etc., than they will generally pack all that material stuff i.e. excess clothes, material electronics, family pictures/valuables etc-etc-etc., into it... The 56L main capacity large size is made even bigger if one doesn't load it up with useless junk i.e. mass clothes, electronics etc., or keeps everything compact and organized as possible etc., and kept to critical basics that the body cannot live without i.e. food and water and hygiene etc... Since I can force my body to fast from food for several weeks if need be., and up too an week without water depending on the climate I am in., I can pack the main compartment with enough food(MREs, Snacks etc) and water-bottles(reusable) to last me 1-week normal with three meals a day and 3-4 bottles of water; or three weeks or more [if rationed right on crumbs and small bites and tiny sips of water here-there to extreme dependency!] tops... Having such a large capacity 'main-compartment' as this 56L i.e. deep, wide and thick etc., is -- helps out tremendously in extending your life on the run until you can find a place that is safe and comfortable to settle down and dig in.

{{{Design}}} The design of this Backpack is really well thought out and put together physically!!! I don't see any designs out there on packs as good as this -- and especially at such and affordable low price; maybe on packs that are $150+ range... It has many pouches of which breaks down to roughly @ ""16"" or so pouches of varying sizes and including the two zippered @ ""Pistol Holders/Holsters"" on each of the sides of the Belt -- of which can be utilized as @ ""Utility, Accessory, Electronic, Trauma etc Pouches"" if not for holding your Sidearm(s)... I don't need a Laptop/Notebook, since I have my @ ""(LG Spectrum 2) Mobile Smartphone"" -- of which does all that and is compact... So the inside @ ""Laptop Compartment"" will be utilized for my clothes i.e. socks, underwear, shirt, towel etc., as an internal divider/organizer... There is mass @ ""P.A.L.S for M.O.L.L.E"" all over the place {front, lower sides, and each side of the belt} which roughly estimates too @ 1x3=3 Rows of 'P.A.L.S for M.O.L.L.E' with 1x6=6 Tabs(lower front/back)., @ 1x2=2 Rows of 'P.A.L.S for M.O.L.L.E' with 1x5=5 Tabs(middle-upper front/back)., @ 1x3=3 Rows of 'P.A.L.S for M.O.L.L.E' with 1x4=4 Tabs(each left and right lower sides)., and 1x2=2 Rows of 'P.A.L.S for M.O.L.L.E' with 1x5=5 Tabs(each side of the Belt)., and finally 1x4=4 Rows of 'P.A.L.S for M.O.L.L.E' with 1x7=7 Tabs(bottom of backpack) -- and great for attaching your sleeping equipment e.g. sleeping bag, pillow, tent, tarps, sleeping pads, sleeping bed/cot etc... There is, of course, plenty of @ ""P.A.L.S for M.O.L.L.E"" on the @ ""Shoulder Pads"" also for attaching more small pouches i.e. compass pouch etc., or utility items i.e. 'angle head' flashlights etc...  Speaking of the @ Shoulder-Pads: one of the best features about the design of the pack -- is the @ ""Shoulder Pads""!!! I really like how they added an fixed @ ""Drag/Carry-Handle"" to the ""Shoulder-blade Pads"" in the back up near your Neck -- of which acts as an @ ""Neck and Shoulder Support Brace"" keeping your Backpack from either sinking too low or riding up too high while also keeping the entire pack sitting even below the bottom of your Neck-line/Shoulder-blade center with your Back... Everything about the design of the pack is flawless and the best out there -- well almost -- and I will get into the negatives shortly that need improvements... This is a really great 'thought-out' practical and tactical design all over!

{{{Quality}}} The ""Quality"" of this pack is excellent!!! It's @ ""600Denier Poly-Nylon""; and while it's not better @ ""Cordura"" or even a higher grade of @ ""1000Denier Poly-Nylon"" -- for ""600Denier Poly Nylon"", this Backpack is of high quality and durable and rugged-tough... There isn't any loose threading on mine, and the stitching is superb... The @ Zippers are also really good and no problems unzipping or zipping the pack i.e. getting snagged, off track etc... For @ $70 -- you get more than your money's worth and then some, and worth every bit of it for the features and quality of this pack!

{{{Comfortability}}} This thing is extremely comfortable, and that is all I need too say!!! It feels really good and supportive on me... Of course: if you have an @ ""A.L.I.C.E(Pack) Frame"" laying around -- you can probably rig this baby up too it, and get even better 'load-carrying/balancing' support and maximize its potential and extend its lifespan from tearing etc...  But by itself: this thing feels great -- even with heavy loads, it's way better than others I have had and used!

{{{Negatives}}} Here are the negatives as I see them and really damper its potential as the greatest Backpack of all time, below...
v
1. Belt w/ Holster-Pouches is Fixed to Backpack and Non-Removable...
2. Belt Length is Extremely Short -- larger framed people will have to make extensions with some @ 1.5"" Tri-Glides with Polypropylene-Nylon Webbing and Quick-Release Buckle(s)...
3. Lack of any @ ""Load Support Straps w/ Buckles""... There is only two @ ""Load Support Straps w/ Buckles"", and they are on the tiny small utility pouches on each of the upper sides of pack... There is no @ ""Load Support Straps w/ Buckles"" going down or sideways -- and this greatly effects the use of the pack i.e. load shifting side-too-side and bouncing up-and-down., more prone too tearing/ripping under heavy loads etc-etc-etc... My @ (NcStar VISM)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VISM-by-NcStar-Tactical-3-Day-Back-Pack/dp/B007XPASMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VISM by NcStar Tactical 3 Day Back Pack</a>&nbsp;Backpack has @ 1x2=2 'Load Support Straps w/ Quick-Release Buckles"" going both sides and downwards/upwards, as almost all Backpacks do that I see on the market -- and this one should too, since it is far larger than those and more prone to ripping because of its size and load-carrying capacity...
4. The @ 1.5"" Belt, is sewn-on the @ Holsters/Belt-Pouches at the @ ""bottom"" line instead of the @ ""middle"" as is proper -- and this causes the waist-belt to be imbalanced and prone to bending outwards, getting twisted in a knot, and flopping over downwards instead of staying even compressed up against your mid-section/stomach...
5. There is no @ ""P.A.L.S Tabs for M.O.L.L.E"" sewn on the bottom region of the @ Holsters/Belt-Pouches -- which the @ 1.5"" Nylon-Webbing/Belt-Extension is sewn and takes-up i.e. they left it blank, when they should've sewn the extra row over it giving 3-rows instead of 2...This leaves only @ 1x2=2 Rows of 'P.A.L.S Tabs for M.O.L.L.E' on each of the Holsters/Belt-Pouches, and greatly minimizes the size of @ M.O.L.L.E-Pouches that you can use i.e. large M.O.L.L.E-Pouches won't be secured properly enough and flop around like a rock skipping over water etc., and left only able to use small M.O.L.L.E-Pouches...
v
Continued}}} These few things really damper on its potential for me!!! But regardless of all that -- I still regard this as the best pack on the market for the price and even compared to more expensive ones just from what you all get with it and the quality... I can rig-up my own @ ""Belt Extenders"" with the required materials to fit me... I can rig-up some @ ""Load-Support Straps w/ Quick Release Buckles"" with the required materials... I can even probably, once I put my creative mind to good use, even devise a way to correct the Belt problem from #4... And the fact that the @ Belt with Belt-Pouches/Holsters are fixed and non-removable, doesn't bother me at all -- just a personal preference for them to be and isn't really a negative at all... So all these negatives in no way effect the Backpack at the end of it all, since I can fix them -- just wish that they were done that way properly in the first place and wouldn't have to go through all that painstaking task of fixing the negatives I see.

{{{My Setup so Far}}} I am just beginning to re-build it all e.g. my survival rig/pack etc., from scratch and will take quite some time with my low finances to complete... So far I have installed ""pouch wise"" alone: an @ Voodoo M3 Field Medic Pouch(right lower side)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MOLLE-Compatible-MIlitary-Style-M3-Medic-Bag-Combat-Medical-Kit/dp/B003EGQHOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MOLLE Compatible MIlitary Style M3 Medic Bag, Combat Medical Kit</a>; an @ Fox Tactical Inc.

It's looking really good now, and coming along!!!

{{{All-and-All, Overall}}} This is an amazing Backpack and you cannot beat it i.e. quality, features and all for the price!!! Superb Quality and Great Design and Extremely Comfortable for its size capacity!!! Even if this Backpack fails, I will still buy another one -- so long as they are still produced and available... My previous newer pack before this [linked above in ""negative"" section!] -- my @ (NcStar VISM) Backpack -- has since been given free to somebody who needed and wanted it... Both of them are excellent Backpacks; but I really-really loved this one better the most and I am extremely satisfied with it!!! Everything you see in the product photo is what you get... But you cannot enjoy and appreciate it until it's in your Hands and on your Body in person, like with me... Shipping and Arrival was very fast, within a few days... No defects or problems with product or services... I Highly recommend unto others to look at and get this before any others!

Pros)
+ Excellent Quality
+ Excellent Design
+ Excellent Quantity of Features
+ Excellent Support
+ Excellent Comfortability
+ Excellent Size Capacity
+ Excellent Price$

Cons)
- As stated in ""Negative"" section...

I give it a *****5 Pentagramstar of Excellence!!!"

They both feel just as secure, but this one is less expensive and is much easier to use on the descent due to the positioning of the release lever. I purchased this with a Petzl left-hand ascender due to what was in stock at the time, and this one definitely feels better to use. Were I to get them over again, I'd get a right and left handed ABC ascender."

I like the cobble texture of the rubber and it should provide a more secure grip surface in varying conditions than the plain polymer. I had the A-grip on it previously for several years and loved it, but it was incompatible with the Crimson Trace I added a couple of years ago, as it is a full wrap and would have covered the laser activation pin beneath the trigger guard (I highly-recommend that you ""google"" it, if you're looking at grips and don't have a below-trigger laser, as it is worthy of consideration in comparison with this one, and uses a great, long-term adhesive). Speaking of adhesives, my only concern with this one is whether or not its  adhesive will remain stable over the long haul, seems pretty good initially....as with all things, time will tell, I guess."

Ive put about 30 arrows through the rest so far I've had 0 issues with it other then the shape of the ""capture"" ring doesnt leave much room for forward adjustments with the rest on bows with less then a 6 & 1/2 inch brace height (Bow Madness 34 is a 6"" brace height"") so it looses a star for a minor lack of movement. Overall the rest is great from what i have seen other then the moevment so if your looking for a decent drop away with out shelling out over $60 this is a great rest."

The deer was down in 5 seconds having run about 40 yards. These are excellent, razor sharp broadheads and with them I don't feel any need to fuss with mechanicals. They are easily sharped due to the blade angles, just place on a whetstone/diamiond stone and rub back and forth. There is a video of this on their website.

Best of all G5 makes a ""preseason"" version of this which is the same thing without having edges on the blades. Excellent for practice.

A fine, fine product, I'll gladly use these time and again.

Tackle was a Horton HD 150 crossbow, aluminum Horton Lightening Strike arrows, G5 Montec broadhead and Hawke SR scope. Arrows literally occupy the same hole during practice sessions.

UPDATE

I decided to try resharpening this broadhead since it was in pretty good shape after the above deer. It was extremely easy to do, just lay it flat on a sharpening stone and rub back and forth. There is a video on G5's website showing this and it works really well. I feel the broadhead is now sharper than it was when I first got it and I'll be sending this one down range again. Seems to be a really good, simple, effective design."

I bought these gel pads and the Serfas Echelon bar tape. The combination results in a substantially cushioned grip compared to the 18 yr old deteriorating cinelli tape with electrical tape patching I had before.  Road vibrations and bumps still feel like they're transmitted through the bars to my hands, wrists, and arms almost the same as before, just a slight damping from the extra cushioning. I think I do lose something in terms of road feel but not so much as to give me substantial concern over the bikes handling. But over a longer ride, 15-20 miles or more, at least up to 35 miles or so, I no longer get the tinglies and the numbness is very much reduced. Where it might have been hours before the numbness was completely gone, now its unnoticeable shortly after my ride, half hour at the very most.
Installation was pretty easy, put them on the bars and wrap them with bar tape.  I cut the top pieces a bit for a better fit and adjusted them as I was wrapping them to keep things straight.  I don't know if the top pieces do all that much for me as I usually have my hands on the bottom, but I would acknowledge a marginal increase in comfort when riding in this position."

6910,1991,Female,36000,580.3914198515474,No,Yes,Northeast,CT,5,"06 27, 2012",Epic blade.,"This is truly, the big blade of blades. Made in the USA, which is reason enough to like it.  Straight out of the box it was sharp enough to shave with (not exaggerating, it lifted hair off clean and smooth).  It chops, splits and slices like nothing else.  This blade is a little bigger than a traditional kukri, but is not monstrous, and is very comfortable in the hand.  Those familiar with kukri blade will notice that the Ontario has a bit more of an angle than the traditional style.  That threw me off a bit at first, but after using the blade in the field for a few days, I think the angle is spot on for chopping.  The blade is thick enough to withstand pretty much anything, and I split some pretty big pieces of wood by batoning the blade through, with no problems.  The handle is superb, and easily stays in the hand.

Now for the sheath.  This is what everyone seem to have a big problem with.  I didn't think it was that bad.  It covers the blade, keeps it where it should be when the blade in on a belt, and isn't too hard to get the blade in or out of.  Could it be better? Yes.  The Ontario Spax is sold with a superb sheath, Molle compatable for military issue.  It would be nice to have that type of sheath for this knife.  But I don't think the sheath is as bad as some reviewers have made it sound.  And if you don't like the sheath, make a different one.  I intend to have a Kydex sheath made for mine, with more attachment options.

All in all, this knife is well worth the money.  I have used a Cold Steel kukri, and this is far better, at a much lower price.  Just keep in mind that this is a big blade: if you want a belt knife, or survival/hunting/camping knife, this might be a little more than what you need.

Ontario continues to impress with this product, and they have got me hooked on their products.

And as a side note, if/when Z-Day arrives, I am pretty sure that with this kukri and my Spax, I'll be able to slice through hordes of brain-hungry undead with ease."

Unlike what the description says, it has the PU/leather cover only on the top & sides, and has a cheap fabric on the bottom.  That fabric is the problem.  I am using it for children to practice tumbling on a hardwood floor.  The mat slides all over with the lightest activities.  Rug pads don't seem to hold it as secure as I would like, so I'm searching for another option to keep it from shifting.  Also the PU surface is a bit slick,  I wish it were a little more grippy.  The foam seems nice, but time will tell how it holds up.  It is so lightweight that I am concerned it won't last.  It does have a little memory (will hold a handprint for a few seconds.)

Air mattresses have came along way, or at least this model has since I last fooled with them.  I bought the twin size for camping. I took it on a dry run by camping in the comfort of my bedroom. Wow! I slept so well and awoke with hardly any aches and pains (arthritis, hip injury, neck issues). I slept on it for another week, reluctant to give it up. So I put it on top of my regular mattress! A bit high up.  One problem I see is that there is no way to aerate between you and the plastic, so it can get wet from sweat or moisture build up. I'm looking into different mattress pads to help with this ( long term use).
Also, this is an air mattress and one simply can't do things on it like a regular mattress, like stand up, kneel, jump up and down, if you want it to perform as it should, so if that's in the plan, then just buy a regular fiber mattress. It does have a screw type port, which i think is better than only a friction type seal. Also, it is normal to have to put a few puffs of air back into it every now and then, this is true of all air mattresses and it does not mean it's poor quality or leaky."

The read out is clear and it seems to be very durable.  The date on the back of mine is 5 year limited warranty  with free service through Sept 2017.  I bought this in April 2016 so they are really giving me more than one year for the free service and then from Oct 2017 to Sept 2021, the fee is $10.  Honestly though, I don't know what could go wrong if you keep it dry.  It's only a few dollars to replace the battery and I don't think the battery life is a warranty item so I'm not taking a star away because of the date and warranty timing.

What does happen though is that the buttons get pushed when the stopwatch is in my bag.  I often find the time maxed out or the watch still running when I pull it out of my bag.  I previously had an Ultrak 340. Great stopwatch and the buttons did not get pushed while it was in my bag (note: the Ultrak 340 doesn't show split times).

I love the readout and the split screen and the quality is very good.  The button issue is a tradeoff.  It's easy to use when timing events because you get a clear button push, but because the buttons are so easy to use, the watch will turn on in your bag.  For my use (personal swim training), I wish there was a little rim around the buttons to protect the buttons, but that might make it harder to use the watch for timing events.  If you are timing events, this is the perfect stopwatch.  For me, I just stick it in my swim fins and that keeps the buttons from being pushed."

They've worked great so far, and they were cheap. A huge step up from the spring collars I'd been using.

I will say I don't think they'd handle much abuse, and I don't know how well they'd hold up to olympic lifts where the barbell is dropped under load frequently.  I perform bench, squat, dead, rows, OHP, curls, etc with these.  They've held OK on my dumbbell handles when I held them up vertically with a 25 lb plate on one side just to see if the clamps would last; they held on for 20 or so seconds before I got bored and put it down.

The real reason it's a 4 instead of a 5 star review is that I don't see anything outstanding about this particular brand/product to stand out from the other myriad plastic lever clamps available (except for the colors available, which I kinda liked-thats why I chose them).  They're not exactly heads and shoulders above anything else but they're affordable, they're good, and they come in pretty colors.  They are not as stout as the competition grade collars by any stretch, but they're also a fraction of the price."

I love the charging base for the backup battery. I do endurance riding, so I fully expect to use the backuip battery. With the headlight, I know people are seeing me. Install was soooooo easy. Just take off the tension nut, slip the strap over your bar, and screw back on the tension nut. Leave a tad bit of slack so you can adjust the headlight, before snugging it down. Don't over tighten as you will strip the plastic threaded strap. Build quality is great, and feels rugged. So far I have 3.5 hours and two rides on this light. Have not recharged yet. Using only steady flash mode. Light stays in place well on my road bike handlebar. Self contained, so there is no cables or battery packs strapped to the bike. At this time, I can't think of any negative comments at all. Spend the extra few dollars for this great quality light, as it is worth your safety. Highly recommend."

I decided to buy these for him despite the other bearings being new. I told him he could use the original bearings as back-ups. WHAT A DIFFERENCE! Even though I lubricated the OBEC 5 bearings which dramatically improved the wheel spin, these Mini Logo bearings just blew them away from the get-go. My son says their's a huge difference in the distance his board rolls now. I guess you can call us both fans now.

The only thing I didn't like about these bearings was the packaging. They came in a small plastic ziplock bag. I was expecting a tin or even a paper box like the competitors are packaged. But if the packaging is what allows them to keep the price low, then by all means, ziplock bag it is.

I'll report back to weigh in on longevity and cleaning."

It's actually a nice compromise between padding and stability.  Some of the more thickly-padded mats are difficult to balance on.  This one is padded, but not to the extreme.  So I found it comfortable in savasana but also supportive enough to do, say, tree pose.  I also thought it was enough to support my knees in camel pose.  And it did not slide around on my carpet at all.

I have this in black/gray and the thicknesses of both sides are uniform.  The two layers adhere together well, without any bunching or loose areas.  I can't really see a difference in the sides in terms of performance (I tested both, just to be sure).  It seems more a matter of personal preference.

This did retain a lot of curl which was a little annoying.  If you want to get rid of that, you can either lay it flat for awhile with some yoga blocks or something on the most curled end, or simply roll it in the opposite direction and store.  The curvature eventually goes away.

Right out of the box, this did NOT have any kind of plastic or chemical smell.  (Important if you are going to be putting your face near something...)

For what it's worth, I generally don't sweat during yoga.  I have not used a mat before that would handle sweat well (and I have five yoga mats from different manufacturers).  If this is going to be an issue for you, I'd recommend putting a towel on top of the mat (there are microfiber towels designed for specifically this purpose).

I didn't pay nearly as much as the price listed here. I also own the original Carbon V version, a christmas gift from my two boys.

 I wanted a lighter weight, slimmer, sleeker design than my beloved Himalayan Imports versions, made in Nepal, that could serve as a weapon, if the need arose, as well as a medium duty survival tool.

The CSSMGK is convex ground, which gives more support behind the striking edge than a western ground knife.

IF the steel is above par, the outer layers are of equal size, shape, thickness etc...and IF the heat treat is perfect...and IF the tempering was done correctly...and IF the knife was properly sharpened...you get a winner.

But its still what I consider a medium duty survival or self-defense/combat tool.

The khukuri chopped a salt-treated 1x1 (square) in half nearly by its self, all I did to help was mount the 1x1 so it would stand up straight, set my elbow down on my leg, and used the weight of the knife alone, guiding the chops, and rotated the 1x1.
No edge damage observed. It was a little more dull in tiny spots, which I corrected w/ a field strop and green compound. It would still make paper ""scream"", and shave hair easily.
Its Carbon V counterpart is far more ""durable"" and scratch resistant, but hey, this one is stainless steel.

This knife is great if your looking for a Zombie Attack Endtime Game over scenario blade, or you just don't have time to take care of your knives.

Problem is....if you beat the living hell out of this knifes' edge, you will be in trouble w/o proper tools, (diamond and ceramic sharpening rods/steels/cones of at least 3 ""grits"" and strops) and enough practice to be REALLY comfortable recreating a convex edge.

Take a look at Nutnfancys' Gurka Kukuri Woods Warrior Battle Axe review.

The Sk-5 kukuri featured there is the knife I will grab first for sure, in survival mode. This khuk is a weapon by the bedside.

4 stars for questionable heat treat---i don't know it all, and the Secure-ex sheath that scratched the hell outa the knife before I corrected it.

The sheath in and of itself is sturdy, lightweight, waterproof, has drain holes, all the ""goodies"" you expect.

That 440 outer steel needs to be a point or two harder on the Rockwell scale, IMHO.---to reduce depth of scratches from a sheath.

If they harden it too much the blade would crack under chopping stresses, so I get that.
All in all, ""Zombie Go Boom"" should give this ol' girl a whirl.

Results would be interesting...to say the least!

EDIT: 11/6/13: If you found this review unhelpful, please leave a comment as to why you did so, and I will do my best to address your questions. Otherwise, I suggest a Nepalese made Khukuri from Himalayan Imports, or possibly Tora Blades. These will cost more, but are made of high carbon spring steel, made in the homeland of the Ghurkah Warriors."

The back support is very nice, and the back is nicely padded.  The addition of the hydration bladder pouch is great, and there is tons of velcro and MOLLE webbing on the back as well.  The official ACU camo of my mag pouches differs slightly from the ACU of the vest, but not enough to care.

I love those bottles and I've been using them since I first saw them at Target.  But I'm worried about the effects from the chemicals.  I guess I should have known that BPA would be replaced with something similar (BPS) so it's only marginally safter.

So I was looking for replacements for the plastics and saw the AVEX FreeFlow Autoseal.  Luckily for me they sent me one to test in exchange for review.  I was super happy to try it out.  (Though orange is honestly not my normal color choice...but it's growing on me.  Easy to see on the bike.)  So I have bottles for cycling, soccer, running, work and trips.  And a different bottle for each.  Yeah, I'm nuts.

The good is that the water stays cooler MUCH longer than in the plastic bottles.  Nice on the long hot bike ride or hours on the field.  I miss the nipple from the Camelbak.  The Avex is great and looks better for work (it's honestly a little strange sucking the nipple during a work meeting), but on the bike it's a bit less convenient.  It's also very light.

I will be looking for something else for my bike, I'm just paranoid about hitting my teeth after riding 30 some miles in the sun.  But for regular use, this Avex is great.  I love this."

Well made, light, but still rolls down large, might not be suitable for backpacking.","This is a pretty good tent.  As it says it's a small tent, good for 2 adults. We tried it this weekend and my wife slept in it with our two sons, age 4 and 9.  they were comfortable.

Let up is really easy. It goes up like a traditional popup tent, but the poles are not inside a sleeve. Instead they connect through J hooks on the outside of the tent. This makes setting it up very easy.  You can sleep without the rainfly as the entire tent for the most part is made of think see-through mesh, but you can easily add the rainfly. It sits on top of the tent poles and then connects to the tent via plastic clasps. Very nice as you don't necessarily need extra ropes and stakes to secure it.

The rainfly covers the entirety of the tent.  The front can be pulled out and staked to leave a vestibule.  Protected from light rain and the outside, but still not in the tent.  Great for your boots or a pack.

The back has a flap that opens to allow better airflow.  The corners of the tent have sturdy lashing straps to connect guy wires.

It's a well constructed tent, though the bottom feels a bit light compared to other tents, we'll see how it holds up.

My only real complaint is that it really doesn't' roll up that small.  Though it's light, when it's rolled up and put in the carrying bag, it is very large. Again, not heavy, but large.  It takes up nearly half of the space inside a 45 liter pack.

It's a great tent, comfy, super easy to put up, and with some neat features.  This can easily be my favorite tent for my two kids, but still feel it's a big large for backpacking purposes."

Reasons why this is better than most other vests in its class:

I like that the right butt shoulder rest has a semi-firm tube that extends up the shoulder all the way up thereby adding extra absorption for a shotgun butt and that its not a soft cheapy impotent feeling support like other saggy type foam inserts. Your hydration tube WILL hold securely to this one!

I like that the outer upper mag clip slots have a nice feel to them, sort of a thick rubberized texture and rugged and not just a vinyl feel or look.

The belt is EXTREMELY FIRM which adds support like a tool belt type and doesn't bunch up or spot sag like many do. The design on the hook and loop size adjustment is nice because it is on both sides so you keep the belt centered.

The shoulder straps are wide strong adjustable hook and loop and give great overall support to the vest once weighted down.

Now here is what makes this vest WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER:
What I really REALLY REALLY like about the inside back 'BLADDER' slot is it will fit on the back perfectly an 11""x14""to15"" KEVLAR INSERT... PERFECTLY!!!!!!!!  Now THAT my friends you gotta admit that this is a Bad @$$ OPTION!!!
It has a Velcro closure to keep it packed solid. You can buy the raw Kevlar IIIA insert for about $60 bucks, if not here then ""E""lseware.  In the inside front gut area is on each side of zipper are (2) 8""x10"" zippered panels for Kevlar IIIA Inserts costing $36 apiece ""E""lseware!!!! Now, for full on protection you will want and need to create a simple upper ""T"" shaped sleeve insert  that will hold Kevlar IIIA that will cover the full wide top heart chest area and that will extend down the zipper center about 4"" wide to under lap the gut side panels and then you effectively have a full flac that is A LOT MORE LOWER PROFILE and even better than buying another vest and wearing it underneath!!!!!!!!!!  And not to mention MUCH MUCH less cha-ching than buying a separate vest.  What is really nice is that the material on the inner vest sleeves front and back is an open mesh material that is rugged yet helps function to keep you a tad bit cooler than if you had solid material up against your undershirt. Those under-mesh types of shirts are pricey and bulky and this has it built in all over!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This concept effectively turns this Vest into a $1000 Vest in my humble opinion!

The Velcro everywhere is pretty tight hook n loop and is not the MOST expensive on the market I have found but it is as good and better as any other quality typical vest on the market that I have found in this class. You do not need better than I think.

The sides have three ""PULL"" tabs each and make it really nice to custom secure your vest depending on the undergarment thickness and depending on if you put your Kevlar Inserts in or not . Probably the best side design I have seen for quick sizing.  I would prefer to have Velcro on the tab ends so they may be folded back to secure onto the vest back so they are not flopping around so they are not so easily grabbed in a combat situation. I am 5'10"" 190 pounds and there are effectively 4 more inches of room on each side(8 inches total) when these are both fully extended on me beyond the 2 inches on each side (4 inches total) I pulled out and sized on me already without the Kevlar inserts.

The six shotgun ammo secure slots are tight thick stretch material that should not wear out easily. It is affixed via its hook n loop and can be worn outside the also removable or adjustable hook n loop upper chest pocket or AS A GREAT BONUS may also be secured on the inside of the pocket to hold things from rattling around depending on your preference.

The vest will hold four average assault gun magazines and a total of six hand gun magazines! The Velcro is VERY generously sized on ALL pockets, very secure!

The back has a very large 6 horizontal x 4 vertical strip webbing which are fantastic because if you use the internal slots for Kevlar then you can attach a bladder and more to the exterior webbing.

There is a very large bumper sticker sized hook n loop on the back upper that can be taken to an embroider or you can iron on your necessary or ""personal"" (""DEPLORABLE1"" is my) statement (Thanks Hillary For The Idea!). Alternately you could affix a large machete sideways to it for quick deploy in a combat situation, only of course if you warn the perp first that ""they will not get that hand back""... ;).

The holster holds my Beretta 92FS LE INOX Police Special 9mm Semi Automatic Pistol Perfectly and it is a longer pistol than others so it should hold just about any reputable semi auto. The Baretta fills it out well but it deploys flawlessly and smoothly! The gun holster holds very solidly to your gut because it is not just Velcro but also two adjustable straps so you can custom tilt it, one above and one to the left side that keep it from being ripped off.  The holster is open at the side end allowing for various sized barrels and some silencer tips can be slid through... ""allegedly"".

The zipper is thick and smooth but not too smooth. Time will only tell if it will stay of or if it will need a velcro under tab affix... we shall see.

If there was one downside to this and its not really a downside to many, it would be that the cell phone carrier on the left shoulder upper is too small for most wider android touch screen cell phones however it does fit a thin flip phone very nicely and might fit some thinner phones and it would stretch the sides out to fit most and I am not so sure if the upper Velcro closure would be long enough to close once filled depending on how long your phone is. it would be good for an Ipod or etc. Sadly the pouch is not removable  but then it is so small that if it was it might easily fall off in a combat situation, soooooooo...

All in all this is WAY MORE vest than you could ever hope to buy for the money!!!  I say pull the trigger on this one!

The spring really seems to make a difference; there is a decent price difference between this rack and the same rack without the spring, but in my opinion (never having used the non-spring version, that is), the spring is completely worth it. I have used the Topeak Office Bag that clips on, and it's wonderful; the rack keeps it in place within a quarter of an inch. I've also used a bungee cord, which works well given the large number of possible places on the rack to hook it. However, the spring comes in handy when you have no other type of restraint system handy. I've clipped a jacket under the spring and it hasn't budged.

The installation is incredibly simple; the rack comes with only a few different parts, includes all necessary bolts, and also includes a mount for a tail light. You'll need a 5mm hex wrench to install the rack, but that's it."

I have normal hand proportions, not overly fat, short, long, or narrow fingers. The gloves fit somewhat snug at the wrist but loose at the finger openings. These gloves are very very thin and I do not expect them to last long at all. I bought them to keep sun off my hands while kayaking and I trust Columbia and their UV ratings. I've been wearing their shirts and pants for years and never have sunburn problems. I hope these gloves are tougher than they feel. I am paddling 30 miles over the next 3 days and will report afterwards.

Update: These performed very well overall. Decent sun protection but not as good as the Columbia shirts. I got no burn on my hands after two sunny and one cloudy day (all day exposure every day) I could see a clear tan line where my shirt stopped and the glove began. These are very fast drying and comfortable. The grip on the paddle was at first horrible but improved over time. These gloves won't last very long but I'll probably buy another pair when they wear out."

They are well made with nylon tips which wear very well and a very thin barrel. They are balanced from front to back reasonable well. If you are starting out and wish to try a number of different types of darts in various weights, this is a good dart to try. The barrel is knurled as well as banded. Each person has to decide on the pluses and minuses of this type of design. I find it very comfortable without any hindrance to the throw.
Since the Silver Thunder has a thin barrel, the dart deflection, as it hits the target, should be less. These are meant to be used on the electronic targets. The set does not include any extra parts, such as spare tips.
The barrels are nickel plated over a base metal that I can't determine. The nickel silver also called German silver and is very hard and likely will not ever be worn off of the dart. The metal is made from nickel, zinc and copper and is often used on very long wearing costume jewelry.
I particularly like the light 18 gm. feel of these nylon tip darts for electronic play."

The disc brakes need to be broken in properly in order to avoid ""the shakes"". My front disc brake would shudder and rattle like crazy until I broke the pads in good with some good hard stops. Derailleurs on these types of bikes can be tricky, so I took mine to a local bike shop to be assembled and tuned properly. It was well worth it. Personally, I think that this bike is worthless for off-roading. The ride is too harsh with no shocks. I know it says hybrid, but this is really a souped up road bike that poses and looks like a hybrid. The stock seat that comes with the bike is like sitting on a brick. The first thing most people are going to do is go hunting for a new saddle, so be prepared to add 20 to 50 smackers plus shipping to the cost of the bike for a new seat. Don't be afraid to put a big fluffy cruiser saddle on this bad boy. Other than that, the bike is beautiful. It's like a work of art. There are pre-drilled and tapped holes and bolts to install water bottle holders on the frame in two places. Holes for a rear fender or rack are also there as a plus. The bike is really quiet, and the Shimano shifters and Altus Derailleurs are pretty awesome. Turns are tight, and the 27.5"" tires deliver nice acceleration with little effort in higher gears. Overall, if you are looking to do some commuting or cruising around on paved trails and city streets, then this bike will probably fit that need very well, but if you like hitting the trails and rougher terrain, then go for a good mountain bike with some shocks on it.

Update: It's been a couple of months now, and 100 plus miles later, the bike has held up pretty good. The only thing I have to complain about is the fact that you cannot raise the handlebars up any higher. The two shims that come with it are all you can get for height without getting more shims and replacing the shaft with a longer one. On long rides, I find myself wishing that I had at least another two to three inches of height. The ride is also pretty harsh. I keep the tires at 65 PSI, and you can still feel every single bump and deformation in your path. If there is a divot in the sidewalk or road, you had better stand up on the pedals and pull the front tire up, or you are going to end up with a bicycle seat buried up in places it shouldn't be, and your arms are going to get a really nasty jolt. I'm afraid that if I don't, then I will get a snake bite on the tube or damage the wheel. Even with these little issues, the bike is still awesome, and I would buy it again anyways.

Update 1 year later: Love the heck out of this bike. The only thing that annoyed me was the fact that, like some of the other reviewers have noted, the spokes on the wheels are not tight, and you will quickly find them out of true after X-amount of miles when you first get the bike. After a little wrenching and making them true again, I was back in business. Make sure to visit youtube for some great videos on how to adjust your spokes. Anyone can do it themselves with a little patience and a spoke wrench or good old-fashioned adjustable wrench if that is all you have on hand."

Condor makes plain, effective, sharp steel work knives. The edge holds thru long periods of cutting. Sheath is very thick, well made leather with a nice wide belt loop.  Top of blade is bead blasted. Keep blade clean, dried and oiled or it can rust.  This is the kind of knife you would see an outdoorsman or commercial fisherman wear every day for all kinds of utility work.

I was riding with Specialized S-Works Turbo tires and experiencing flats regularly, as in one every third ride on average.  80mm stem tubes and CO2 cylinders can get pretty expensive....  Along with the flats, came cuts in the sidewall that rendered these expensive tires useless.....my LBS sold me one of these and I bought one more from Amazon.  Having hit road debris that would have given me flats with my other tires, I'm sold on these.  I've just ordered another one.  For someone who lives in a state where our four seasons can be summarized as hot, very hot, very, very hot, and hot - a ""four season"" tire may seem odd, but we do get rain and we have sharp stones and thorns littering our roads.  At speed in a straight line (as in a fast descent), the tires sometimes feel a little squirrelly but they hold the road and are solid when cornering.  I'm riding with a 25mm on a Zipp 404 in the rear and a 23mm on a Zipp 303 on the front.  I've ordered another 23mm for my 404 front wheel for days when the winds are calm.  So my bike now weighs 16lbs....but it's okay, I'm losing weight to offset the weight of the tires LOL."

I haven't worn these socks out to work yet. I'll update this review when I do.
I am going to rate these now, even before being worn.
It's very obvious that these are 5-star socks. The toe seems are very smooth and almost nonexistent. The heel is nice and deeply cupped. The padded areas are very defined.
I have several pairs and I haven seen a single stitch out of place.
The non-padded areas are very sheer.
They look like they are going to be really comfortable to wear.

These are definitely warm weather socks. It'll be a couple months before I wear them to work."

8003,1978,Female,101000,558.0070697385514,No,No,South,GA,5,"06 1, 2014",Not just for reloaders or nitpickers,"We've all probably been to the range & seen the guy who brings a full-size truckbed full of range gear & a quart of coffee in a thermos. He sets up & sits for hours obsessively shooting hand-polished reloads, from a bull-barrel rifle mounted in a bench vise, & then occasionally makes minute adjustments & written notes in an attempt to gain more accuracy from his rifle (even though he couldn't hit the broad side of a barn shooting standing offhand).

Yeah, you don't need to be that guy to enjoy this chrono. No offense to the bench-rest hand-loaders, but you don't need to be a range wonk to get use out of this chrono, to enjoy it, or for it to provide you valuable information.

I've had two of these chronos, & I like the latest model even more. Right out of the box, with no reading of instruction, I found the unit intuitive-enough to use immediately. It's reliable & seems to measure even the smallest/lightest .22LR shot from a pistol. For example, I tried some odd 20 grain lead-free ""green"" rounds & even their velocity measured with no problems. The unit will give you nine strings of shots, & will tell you the velocity of each individual shot, the average, the extreme spread, & the standard deviation. You can also easily delete strings or fliers (individual shots that are way outside the norm).

One suggestion I'd make to get the most use out of the unit: Buy a nice & tall tripod, & set the chrono up on it in a way where you can line it up with a target or two. If you're focused on determining fps, you can simply shoot blind through the gates. But since you're burning up ammo, might as well do some target shooting while you're at it. I find the gates large-enough to casually shoot pistol through without worrying about shooting the metal rods.

I can't say enough good things about this chrono. It's been very educational to see the differences between different ammo types. For example, I found a 200 fps difference between two brands of ammo even though they both featured 180 grain JHP bullets. It's also been interesting to see how one box of ammo-- from one manufacturer-- can have so much of an extreme spread. I shot a box of American Eagle 180 grain FMJ rounds and there were some really wild variances. Some rounds were clocked at 950 fps, & several fliers were clocked at only about 500 fps. I'll never buy that brand of ammo again. Too inconsistent.

One last suggestion: To protect the unit, keep the muzzle 5-10 feet back from the display & the front gate. Aside from causing erroneous readings, you don't want your muzzle blast to dirty up the unit or destroy it."

I have hip problems so I have to have a mattress.  This one is comfortable, and doesn't weigh too much.  It has been durable, and I believe it has helped me sleep pain free.  I have two things I would change it I could: 1) it is a pain to inflate and deflate with 6 separate valves.  It would be nice if they could make it with just one air valve.  2) make it a little less slippery.  It tends to slide around a bit.  But I am still going to use it (unless I can afford a Big Agnes mattress one of these days)."

If you have a vacation home or a really strict homeowner's association that doesn't allow permanent basketball hoops, this is the answer.  With the sleeve, that you buy separately, you can mount this in a manner that you get the benefits of a permanent system with all the benefits of it being removable and adjustable.

For me, the vacation home is the perfect place to mount this sucker.  I take it down when I'm not around and that way I don't attract unwanted visitors and it's not unsightly.  You can get a bigger backboard but those tend to be much heavier.  Also, your skill has to be higher to play on the 48"" backboard.  Overall, a great system that you can remove when you're not using.  Definitely consider the pros of this.  The shatterproof design also means that it's less risky to remove and take down than one that has a glass backboard."

I *love* the super long tube cleaner and I do not wonder if junk is growing in the tube as more as I can get every last centimeter scrubbed with it. There is something therapeutic about knowing the entire length of that tube is squeaky clean. I use the larger blue brush to clean the inside of the bladder as well as random stainless steel bottles that need a quick rinse if I cannot find another bottle brush. It really seems to get in the crack of the bladder seams well as well. The hanging thing seems like it is a little bit too small for the 1.5liter bladder we have so I just kind of loosely stick it in the bladder to hang vs having it ""all the way in"" (and this is where it lost a star I felt like either the hanger was going to break or the bladder was going to get a rip in it if i tried to force it in. The small brush is used to clean the bite valve and cap of the bladder. Now that we have this though I feel like we can safely use our camelbak for our runs and not have to worry about getting sick from backwash germs.

My only problem with these is that they aren't for kneeling, squatting, or even sitting. My bought the size 8, and it's almost too loose around my waist, the zipper diggs in when you bend your knees even a little. It's nothing that a little rearranging doesn't fix, but a with the light fabric the convertible style is completely unnecessary. The stretch fabric makes the zipper a bigger problem than it would be on a baggier, less yielding style.

I love the color scheme of black and lime green, it's a great way to add a little personality to something that until recently came in very few colors. I immediately plugged the headset in to charge which happened very quickly. I was playing around with them in no time.

Connecting to my Galaxy S4 was super easy. Just power on the headphones and turn on Bluetooth scan on the device. My phone found the earbuds pretty quickly and connected on the first try. I did not have to make any changes or adjust settings on either device. Sound quality is really good and the noise cancelling also works fabulously. I tested the noise canceling against my blaring television and I was impressed. The volume control is on one earbud and is really handy. I tested out a phone call and I could hear clearly and the other person heard me. I also played with some of the voice features on my phone and it worked marvelously.

The earbuds also come with different sized bits that go into the ear for comfort. I had to size mine down to the smallest which is very comfortable. They feel just as light as earbuds that are fully wired. I feel like these are safer than the full wire type. Especially if you where them while being active. I really like these and plan to get a lot of use out of them. I would even consider buying more as gifts.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review."

I was wooed by more expensive products, most costing nearly the same as or more than the rifle, but in the end I had to justify the likeliness of using this in a true combat scenario and found the chances extremely minimal.  With that being said, I very much enjoy the product.  It is solidly built being nearly entirely metal.  I found no quality issues and the controls are easy to use.

I like having 4 reticles to choose from.  I do not foresee flipping between them as once I found the one I liked I saw no need for the others.  However, having that choice is nice.  The unit offers 3 visible light brightness settings and two night vision IR settings.

The control knob to change the settings has an extended nub on the ""off"" setting so you can easily make adjustments without looking.  If you want full brightness in visible light just rotate the largest nub from the 3 o'clock position to the 9 o'clock.  Simple.  The control knob for the reticle selection is also easy to use and there are clear icons showing the available selection.

The holoscreen is large enough for its purposes.  It is green tinted on the shooters side and orange on the muzzle end.  It does occasionally pick up glare on the shooters side around the edges that can be distracting but do not impede its use.

Sighting adjustment is done with a hex wrench and when you turn it you get distinct clicks so you can gauge your changes by feel.  I am not sure what increment each click is.  I did not look at the manual.  I was able to get an absolute co-witness with my iron sights in just a matter of a few clicks right out of the box.

Attaching the unit to the rails is easy.  It takes a little force to flip the cam lock over, but once you have it stays in place and there is no play.  I do wonder how easily the cam lock lever will snag on things though.  It runs parallel to the unit with the tip facing the shooter but stands out a good half inch or more which could potentially allow for a sling strap or something else in your kit to hook onto it and potentially unlock the unit causing it to fall off.  It would however take some force mixed with bad luck to do this.

I have not had the unit long enough to report on battery life.  As well I have not put the unit through harsh conditions to be able to speak to how well it holds up in rain, mud, dust, etc.  I expect it should be fine given the overall quality and tightness of the unit.

Final words:  I paid around 110 bucks for this product and feel it meets all my needs perfectly.  I will buy more for future rifle builds.  That being said if I ever found myself about to ship out to a war zone or going on some epic hunting safari... I might have to spring for military grade optics.  But for going to the range and having an optic for a rifle that may see use in a defensive scenario on my property; this totally fits the bill and the money I save I can put into the ridiculous cost of ammo."

This is small and lightweight.  I use it to hold my cell phone, an extra pair of glasses, a diaper, small pack of wipes, an Epipen, credit cards, cash, ID.  Keys have to go in my pocket, no room for them and the other stuff.  The glasses are one item too many for it not to look like its bursting open.  This I resolved with lots of velcro additions to hold it shut and make it keep its shape.

One serious design oddity:  The the strap that goes around it to keep it closed, if you don't latch it, it hangs down and looks stupid.  My glueed on velcro solution for it didn't hold up and I'm going to have to sew it in place.  That's probably its biggest design flaw.  Though really, the designers of these bags need to overstuff them and look for what doesn't work when packed full and then consider how to make it more flexible for people.

I'm happy enough with it that I'm probably going to buy another one, but I'll have to alter it too."

This looks like a compass, that is about it, a shaped object.
I honestly thought these came out of a Novelty Store.

It says something about the product when you read things like, ""if you know how to read a compass.""
If it does not work, it must be you.
Just run home and set it on your kitchen counter with the other compasses to prove to yourself it is working.

The Suunto Clip is designed to push through jungle brush with a constant eye on your bearings.  It works.

You would have to stop and play with this compass every 30 seconds.  It just does not work the same.
Putting each compass on a kitchen counter to show they point...if you use them in your kitchen, okay.

If you want a usable compass on the fly, this is NOT WORTH A DOLLAR.

Leave aside who makes the product.  Is it a functioning product?  NO. It does not compete.
It is like a REPLICA.

Am I buying this for charity??? Or because it actually works???

If you want an actual clip on compass....buy the Suunto.

This tent is roomy, airy and will keep you dry. Plenty of pockets to keep personals and room to sit up and stretch those aching muscles. Packs down in a very compact bundle. As far as previous comments about the rain fly pole, it just takes a little effort to engage it. I would not recommend shortening it as it would make the fly looser than desired.
 Overall, I highly recommend this tent. For the price and the quality of Eureka, it is a exceptional value."

And once you adjust the trimmer for the desired case length, it produces a very consistent case length.  By the way, I found I didn't have to debur the cases after trimming.

It holds a whopping 32 ounce--yes, 32 ounce--Gatorade bottle whole. Yes, the chubby Gatorade bottles! With room to spare!!

I can use it for my entire kitchen cook kit with imusa cup and alcohol stove and fuel. It is very secure on two firm (not limp) straps that are provided with the product, both with snaps. They go through my PALS/Molle straps on the bag well, and securely by weaving them in and out of the straps. So, unlike some other bottle holders, you need not buy Blackhawks or Maxpedition Tac Ties to go with this back--it already comes with the two firm straps that will clip onto your backpack's Molle and Pal system already. That's a nice cost savings.

I love the clip on the top hood, but it also has a large velcro closure, right under the black plastic clip...so you really can use the velcro only for easy access. It's very secure.

Couple points: it has molle straps on the outside of it, which is fine for placing other objects like a knife holster, flashlight holster, etc. BUT, it is less structured than a Maxpedition bottle holder, so you'd really need something in there (a water bottle, for example) to prevent it from getting tippy and floppy with the weight of the knife, if you get what I'm saying. I like the reduced structure of the holder, though in general, as it's great for form fitting many things, like a cup with a handle fits in there nicely (but likely wouldn;t fit in a rigid bottle holder).

The only true negative that I see about this holder is the top flap leaves a little space along the top of the bottle holder itself--a tiny gap on each side even when closed--that might allow desert windstorm sand, rain, etc. into the holder. If one had small items in this bottle holder (e.g. free bullets, candy or such), and tipped the bag, they may come out the edge where the top meets the body. 5.11 really should cut the top of the holder on the sides more generously so they will overlap better with the flip top.

Recommended. I bought one, then liked it so much, I bought another. As of this writing, the Maxpedition water bottle holder is literally 60% more expensive than the 5.11, so I doubt I would have bought two of those based on price alone."

My kids are done with school and they are making plans already for the summer. My family and I, we do tent camping. The Taotronics LED lantern flashlight is a light saver for us, literally. I have already included it in my checklist for camping. I have also been enjoying it for other purposes around the house.
Here is what you may want to know about this light:
At outset, it is not similar to the current lanterns that I have. It is so bright. At 10oz it's slimmer than a can of soda and has 453 lumens of brightness.
In addition, it is very versatile. It is small enough to fit in a purse, but powerful enough to light up a campsite, store or use as an emergency lantern during a power outage.
Thats not all. The lantern has several modes. It comes with battery level indicator, energy saving mode, memory mode, lock-in function, and dimmable. These modes are controlled conveniently with one-button located on top of the lantern. There are six levels of brightness, and is powered by 6 batteries; can be hanged like a lantern or held as a lantern flashlight.
I can already foresee the use of this light inside of our tent to get the kids to bed. I no longer have to worry about flashlights really. It is double-ended opposite CREE LED beads that gives 360 degrees of uniform, shadow-free, ghost-free, and flicker-free light
On the other hand, it is way too perfect for it not to have some drawbacks. The main one for me is the use of batteries, 6 batteries. Granted, when the battery is running down, you will know thanks to the LED battery indicator which will flash to indicate low battery. It also features a locking mechanism so the light doesn't accidentally switch on in your backpack and leave you without power in an emergency.
I so wish it was rechargeable. That could save me batteries
I stated earlier that I use this light around the house as well. Yes, I have used it in our closet. I also used it in our bathroom, our car, and the kids bedroom. This is to state this light is more than just a camping light. It is an all-purpose light for me.

I have been using this light since Ive got it. I would recommend it to anyone.

Very adjustable to work for many sizes and shapes of faces.,"I'm always on the lookout for a good pair of goggles, we live in an apartment complex with a swimming pool in Northern California so we can use it much of the year weather permitting. My daughter really likes wearing goggles when swimming and jumping into the pool, but we've gone through so many pairs of different price points that just don't last. Something always is either off from the start or they quickly fail with regular repetitive use. I received a pair of these swim goggles for free* to try and review and expected them to me another sub-par cheap pair. Boy was I wrong!

I ordered the black and white pair, which arrived packaged into a hard plastic carrying case that you can keep them stored in between uses. Once out of the case we removed the soft plastic protecting the outer eye pieces of the goggles and were surprised to find that they are completely reflective. I can't get a good picture of it, but they are almost as reflective as a mirror when the family members were trying them on I could see myself in the reflection off the front of the eye pieces! The other really wonderful thing about these is that they are completely adjustable to make them fit better on various size faces. They come with three different sized nose pieces which are easy enough to pop on and off to swap them out but not enough so that they are going to easily fall apart in your hands. The strap is also adjustable and I have to say it is one of the easiest ones I have used. I don't know how many times I've bought goggles for me or my kids and the straps say they are adjustable but truly are not or if they are they are so difficult you never want to make any changes to them! The strap is also two so you can adjust it different ways on your head depending on head shape, hair style or swim caps being worn.

Putting these on definitely felt like putting on a pair of sunglasses, I could see the difference in the amount of light that was being allowed in which helps with eye protection out in the sun. It isn't so dark that they would be hard to see while wearing, but rather just enough to take the edge off the sun or really bright lights. This is important since we live in such a bright sunny place that we are almost always swimming outdoors and never inside! These also suction to you face in just the right way when you have the nose piece and straps adjusted right for your face. You can feel the suction, but it's not so much that you feel like they are going to suck your eyeballs out like some goggles feel. I really hate those types and are kind of why I stopped wearing my contacts and goggles into the water. Each time I swim I risk losing or breaking my glasses because I can't see without them and I've gotten tired of ill fitting goggles. This is a pair that I would be comfortable wearing and will start using my contacts and protecting my glasses with. I got them with the intentions of giving them to my daughter but maybe we will share for now. :0) Since they are so easily customizable that shouldn't be a problem. Though I might eventually buy myself my own pair if I find I am wanting to use them often enough!

*regardless this is my 100% honest opinion."

She never took to shower caps, but she doesn't mind this swim cap at all (which given her sensory issues is nothing short of a miracle!)

Pros:
- Large enough for adults, but tight enough for little heads
- Easy to put on/remove without excessive hair pulling
- Cover ears to prevent water from getting in
- Keeps hair completely dry
- Large enough for long hair (probably not dreadlocks, but no standard swim cap is)
- Reasonably priced

I can't vouch for durability yet but I'll update this review as needed.

On a side note: I see the other parents at the pool ""fight"" with their little ones' swimming caps (which incidentally never stay on through the class), and I know I made the right choice! So much better than the old rubber/latex swim caps!!!"

The shipping was really fast!. Upon receiving the flashlight, it came in a plastic shipping bag, then in-cased in a plastic protective manufacture package. When I finally got the package opened, I noticed that this light is really well made. It said ""Made in the USA"" so I am really glad it wasn't made in china. I installed it on my PX4 storm and noticed it fits loosely when positioned in the grove on the rail. The grove on the rail is wider than the lock bar on the light so there is a little bit of play. The PX4 Storm 45 rail grove is really close to the front of the gun which makes this light stick way out in front of the pistol. If the rail lock assembly was shifted to the front of the light, and the rail bar on the light was wider, it would fit better on the px4 storm. I will have to do some mods to my pistol to have this light fit right. I will need to create a new grove on the pistol that is positioned further back and thin out the grove so the light's lock bar locks the light in properly. I would have gave this light a ""5 Star"" because of its quality and where it was made but the title says it fits the PX4 Storm and I don't believe that is entirely accurate. Upon completion, I will update this review.......

***UPDATE***
08/01/2013 - Sent this light back. I typed a letter explaining the issues I was having and they were kind enough to return the light."

8703,1993,Male,119000,677.7251180657832,Yes,Yes,West,UT,4,"08 15, 2017","Quality, good-looking grips but expected darker color.","These are well made grips with a pretty aggressive texture. They look very nice on my SP-01. Both fit my SP-01 right out of the box with no fitting required which was a huge plus. The included Torx fasteners and washers work as well as should be expected; no complaints here at all.

My only big knock against these grips is the color. Buyer beware here. The color shown in the item picture is misleading. I purchased the grey/black grips expecting (perhaps foolishly) that they would closely match the color of my SP-01 like the grips do in the picture. The grips I received are far more noticeably light grey than black so I'll likely be Rit-dying these to a deeper black to achieve what I wanted/expected. For this I removed a star but it certainly isn't a deal breaker for me.

To summarize / TL;DR:

+Well made, quality grips that look great on my CZ and have a very nice aggressive texture.

+Installed onto my SP-01 right out of the box with no fitting required.

-Grip color in item photo (for Grey/Black) does not accurately represent the actual color of the grips I received.

-Actual grip color is far more light grey than black."

Doesn't look like a man-purse.,"I define my sweet spot as a pack that will work for office AND on the trail. I don't want to buy two packs. I don't want to carry a technical backpack with ice axe loops and bulky suspension system to the office. Nor do I want to carry an urban-styled, black, laptop pack on the trail. They typically don't have great waist suspension belts and that just doesnt work for me in the woods. Then there are messenger bags. Would work fine for the office but not at all on the trail.

Stuff I carry
To the office: keys, wallet, camera, lunch, water bottle, pocket knife, Android tablet and maybe a hat and some gloves in the winter. I don't carry a laptop.
For trail/travel: The ten essentials, camera, clothing layers, ham radio equipment and maybe an ENO hammock or a sil-tarp

I want something that works like a messenger bag at work and more like a pack on the trail. I need pockets and dividers to separate and protect my camera and radio gear. I don't like just dumping stuff in a big, top-loading sack and letting everything bang into each other.

I have used lumbar packs in the past. I have a Marmot Flathead. Nice but too small for office. Found the Mountainsmith Day while searching for EDC bags. It has pockets, capacity, durability, flexibility and I even like the way it looks. I opted for the Hops color, which hints at both retro, canvas/leather rucksacks and modern military gear styles without being pretentious to either extreme. Carry handles are nice for the office. Shoulder strap(s) and waist belt for rock hopping.

First impressions
I really like the beefy zippers. They do not bind and are easy to locate thanks to the oversized zipper pulls. A bit disappointed that the front pocket doesnt have any organization features like pouches or pockets for small items. I know those features weren't listed. I just thought those were kind of standard features on pretty much every pack made. Guess Ill have to get some kind of pouch or hard drive case to hold miscellaneous, small items.

First use was a two-mile walk from work. I used only the shoulder strap and not the hip belt. You have to wear it slung diagonally across your chest or it'll slide off your shoulder. The shoulder pad isn't sticky enough to grip jacket. For hikes at the local metroparks, I used both the waist belt and shoulder strap and it was very comfortable, even with two quarts of water on board. Advantage of using the shoulder strap is that you can swing the pack around to the front to get things without removing the pack. For longer hikes, I use the optional strappettes. Allows me to carry more weight in the pack but it does prevent you from pulling the pack around without removing it."

The box was quite smashed. I would have blamed the shipper, but the box this box was in was pristine. (I ordered a few other products that were packaged together.) Perhaps a returned set? I don't have the time to send it back and wait. I'll true it up and send it to powdercoat tomorrow. The entire process will take me less than 36 hours. I gave 2 stars because the fit is great and the threads were somewhat clean. You get what you pay for. Actually, my boss paid for these. so I'm not out anything but the cost of powdercoat. Maybe next time, I'll have more time to send them back. The price point is good as it helped us keep the build kind of cheap.

First off my magazines barely fit. The pack clearly states it is for my model handgun. Secondly, the small portion of velcro on the belt loop portion will not hold hold up over time or under any use. The strap is designed to loop around the belt and Velcro back on itself. There is not enough stap to securely fastened the strap for my double stack mag. The velcro released just by me sitting down and the magazine was left loose.

Lastly, the design for my purpose was not adequate. I purchased this to be an indiscreet magazine holster. Hard to be discreet when the end of the mag sticks out for everyone to see. I had hoped that if the holster was exposed it would appear to be a phone case or an eyeglasses case on the belt. Well, it looks like a magazine holster when exposed. The end of the holster comes to a point which makes the end of the mag stick out too much, revealing what is inside. It would have been better if it was squared off.

If you are looking to be inconspicuous with good, positive belt retention for your mag, I would pass on this. This is going back to Amazon."

Although the screws aren't labeled in the package, they are numbered on the directions: Just turn to the second page and see the quantity of each screw and you have it figured out.  It took me about 90 minutes to put this machine together with a socket wrench and an adjustable wrench.  In terms of quality, I owned a lat machine made by Buckeye Barbell (long out of business) and have used other machines over the 40 years I've been lifting, and I have to say this machine is built extremely well.  It's a compact machine made for home use, so it is somewhat smaller than other lat machines, but I'm 6 feet tall and weigh 185 pounds and this works well for me.  I can get a full stretch using both the lat machine and the low row with cable to spare.  The lat bar is smaller than a standard 48"" bar so some may not like this feature, but I don't like a very wide grip.  For those who have said about behind the neck pulldowns being cramped, two things:  First, you will smash into the seat pad, and second, behind the neck pulldowns are great for ruining your shoulders and rotator cuffs and are one of the worst exercises you can do, so it's not an issue for me.  The seat is smaller than those found on other machines but again, I fit on it with no problems.  I can see someone who is really big having some difficulty but for the average person this is fine.  I can see someone as tall as 6' 2"" using this with no difficulties.  Buy a good low row handle and triceps rope and you're good to go.  The metal is strong on this machine and it's relatively light so if you need to move it, it's fairly easy.  Cables and pulleys are high quality.  I would highly recommend this machine regardless of price."

Bought eight of these tents on Cyber Monday and got an amazing price on them.  Use them for our scout troop.  Love these tents.  Have been using this brand and model from Coleman for over a decade now working with boy scouts.  Have used these in three different scout troops, and they have always worked well.  They are big enough for two boys and their gear, and we have used them on week long camp outs and they work great.

They work great in all seasons, have even had boys stay in these when we were doing winter camping our tents were on top of four feet of snow.

Like them so well that I have two of my own that we use as a family when we camp.  They are quick to put up and easy to take down.  One person can set up the three-person tent in about five minutes with practice.

I really like the fact that they continue to manufacture the tents.  If something breaks or is lost (this happens with Boy Scouts) you can order replacement parts or purchase the tents again.

Also because they are not huge they are quick to take down and fold up.  The large cabin tents can take 12-13 year old 30 or 40 minutes to get folded up.  These can come down in less than 10 minutes.

Good construction, and have held up to monthly camping trips for over a year with limited shown wear and tear."

The knives that were sent as of 3/30/2017 are SW423GSCP which has a half serrated blade. This could be a problem for some. I will just accept the error because of the price. Looks like a quality import but the blade needed honing to make it sharp. The machine screws holding the handle on are about as tiny as they get and are Torx so you will need a special screw driver to check or tighten them. The knives come in a tightly sealed clam shell which has to be cut off around the edges to remove. Be careful, you can really cut yourself on this type of material. Blade was very stiff when new and couldn't be flicked open with the thumb. There are some nylon or other washers inside the handle on each side of the pivot point to minimize wear. Blade locks open securely and you have to use medium force to unlock it and close. Powder coat handles and blade are dark grey. Solid heft and design is good for this price range. Overall looks good.

I feel confident that if a young player can learn shooting with this small aide, it will become possible to establish good hand and elbow habits early on.  That's the only way - by learning early - that anybody is going to be competitive.

The doors on the cabinet close without bulging. I loaded approximately 30 cans with only one small bag of ice. I left the top of the bag open initially and just placed another type of insulated bag, folded on top it. I was amazed over the lack of ice melt, and how cold everything was! I initially used super chill freezer packs, but ice is much better for what I use the cooler for. This is probably the best money I've ever spent on a cooler bag.

Anywho....these are thin, light gloves which will keep your hands warm in moderate weather. I don't ride when it's much below 40*F, but they seem to do a fine job in the 40's, and they block the wind nicely, while not making my hands sweat. If you ride when it's colder than the upper 30's, I'd say you'd need a heavier glove, as I wore them once in the upper 30's with some wind, and my hands were on the verge of getting cold.

They're made well, and designed well, so that no seams or other protuberances get in the way between your hands and the hoods/bars- and they're easy to get on and off.  All in all, a good product that does what it was designed to do."

Mr. Brooks could not afford a new horse with his struggling new company in 1878.  So he borrowed a friend's bicycle.  The bicycle saddle (seat) was terrible.  So, he decided to take his knowledge of leather & put it to use making bicycle saddles instead of horse saddles.  The rest (as they say) is history.

Brooks saddles do require maintenance & upkeep - but worth it.  You may have to play around with the height, angle and fore or aft movement of the saddle to get it right.  But once locked in - you'll know it.  The light bulb will go off in your head telling you why this is still the most sought-after & comfortable line of saddles on the market.  Even without padded cycling shorts - a short 5 to 10 mile trip in the neighborhood is a joy.  And it will only get better with time.  Once broken in (about 150-200 miles) the saddle will conform to your own ""sit bones"", making it special to you & you alone.

The only reason for the 4/5 stars rather than 5/5 is basically for something you cant get around unless you choose to NOT use this product. That is, when you install the QLS system it adds quite a bit of space between your belt and the holster. Makes it a lot harder to conceal if that is what you are trying to do. If you are open carrying then it just puts the weapon further away from your body and makes it more prone to catch things when you turn or bump into things. Aside from that issue its a great piece of technology."

How convenient is it to have your mat carrying sling double as your strap?  This will be great for taking my outdoor yoga class at the farmers market.  I don't like to bring props with me but sometimes I wish I had a strap with me to get a deeper stretch - Im just not as flexible as those college girls! As a sling I love that it is so adjustable.  It will fit all of my mats no matter how thick, and sometimes I like to roll my blanket up in my mat when I go, so that makes them too thick for my cheap elastic slings.  Its easy to use as a sling, although it doesnt feel like the straps cinch too tight around the mat when I put it on.  They are plenty tight when Im carrying it though.

It is nice and sturdy as a strap too.  Its easy to unloop the carrying loops to convert it into a strap.  There are included instructions on how to convert it, but I didn't really understand them so I just fiddled around until I found something that worked.  I prefer straps with d-rings like this, and I found it to be a great length for a strap.  It seems nice and sturdy.  It doesnt slip through my hand and feels really supportive for my stretches.  Also a nice bonus - I like the color a lot.  It even matches my favorite yoga mat!  Im very happy with this strap/sling!

I never use quick connects when pumping up my tires, so that plastic adapter is completely irrelevant to me.  From what I read, that piece is a plastic throw-away.  The pump body feels very sturdy.  Clearly, it is well made.  Although I have only used it 20 or so times I have not had a single issue with the pump's use.  I've tested the gauge and it is very accurate - sufficient to all but pro-riders like Lance Armstrong - with large enough print to read standing up.  I highly recommend the brightly visible yellow version - just a touch of neon there but very attractive.  This makes the pump easy to find.  The wooden handle is a nice touch.  It feels very comfortable with smooth surfaces.  i have not once experienced leakage due to a poor connection.  The addition of a small button to eliminate pressure in the pump's tube prior to removal from the bike's valve stem is a nice feature.  When you release the pump fitting from the valve stem you can almost completely avoid a burst of air.  I am 6' tall and appreciate the fact that this pump is than some others (saves your back) and is sturdy to the ground when pumping (I've only tried it on concrete so far).  Lastly, the pump's rubber air tube is nice and long which lends itself to flexibility of use.  Do not second guess this purchase.  The few extra dollars spent is worth the quality.  I ride with a bike-mounted Lezyne hand pump mounted on my frame.  I once changed a flat and brought the tire up to 120psi (with effort and 100 +/- pumps, the last 20 being a bit tough), so I have experience with the brand.  This company makes good products.  I hope my post helps.  Please feel free to ask any questions.  If I experience any troubles or have further comments to add, I will provide an update.  If you don't see an update, I still feel the same way about this awesome pump! Thanks for reading."

I had ordered a large, but I know I am a size 7 1/4 (which for me is around 23 inches)  this was way too big. Hopefully the medium will fit better.

I hear that this type of material is prone to shrinking if laundered, but there's no way it'd shrink THAT much. Besides, the instructions are specific on how to clean the hat.  In my opinion, you should get the hat to fit right as it's new, follow the instructions for washing, and be happy with it.

I love the fold on the brim as it's very deliberate and heavy-duty."

I really like the simple, yet colorful design of the core sliders. There is more than enough space for your feet and hands as you use them and I really like the black/blue color on them. The double-sided textures make it dual purpose so it can be used both on carpets and hardwood floors.  ""1.00 STARS!""

2. Does It Work?

For the most part, yes! These core sliders remind me a lot of how ab rollers work, except these core sliders are much smoother and I totally suggest these over any ab roller. Of course the movements can be extremely difficult depending on what position you are in and workout you are doing, but I just find them overall to be much smoother than the ab rollers. They really add another dimension to working out and it changes things up a bit as opposed to the regular grind of most workouts. You can get real creative with each exercise and the process is actually quite fun to see just how much you can move the discs with proper form to get your results. I did find that some of the movements for some exercises were quite rigid and didn't seem to flow as much as I'd like them to, which is the same problem that I had with the ab rollers, but it really depends on what type of surface you are on. I'll explain more below.  ""0.75 STARS!""

3. How Quick Does It Work?

You can get a quick and effective workout within 15 minutes or less and even a great warm up in just 5 minutes or so. It depends on your routine and the workouts you do using the core sliders. However, it can be a nuisance to have to switch from a hardwood floor to a carpet constantly depending on what workout you are doing, since some workouts work better on the hard floor and some work better on the carpet.  ""0.75 STARS!""

4. How Does It Feel?

It depends. Generally, it feels great and provides a wonderful workout experience, but some workouts are quite unsmooth depending on the surface and exercise used.

Carpet: The carpet is great for leg exercises and the discs move extremely smoothly without any shoes on, but the pushups are quite rigid and don't feel very natural in their movement and it is hard to get range of movement while doing push ups on the carpet.

Hard Floor: The hard floor is much better for pushups and upper body movements, but the legs don't move freely unless you are wearing shoes in which case they work pretty smoothly.

So where is the best place to use it? Definitely the hard floor as the movements are much smoother and you can do both upper and lower body exercises without much interruption or rigid movement, whereas the carpet is mainly best for leg workouts/movements.  ""0.75 STARS!""

5. Is It Worth The Price?

Well, these are much cheaper than ab rollers and even more effective than them, so I would say, yes!  ""1.00 STARS!""

6. Should You Buy This?

Yes, I recommend that you try them out and I think that you will be pleased at the new exercises that can be implemented in your regime.

7. What's My Rating?

I rate this product a 4.25 out of 5.00 stars and have to round down to 4.00 stars for Amazon's review system.

As others stated in their reviews it is a bit of a hassle getting the sight zeroed.  The Glock's rear sight is in the way of the  adjustment screws.  So, you have to loosen the mounting screws, lift the sight , make the adjustments, reposition and tighten the sight back in place, and fire another group.  Repeat as necessary to get your group in the middle.  I think it tool me 4 iterations to get a good zero.  Once zeroed it seems to hold the zero well.
I had a chance to use the Glock/Viper in an Indoor Defensive pistol match.  It did well.  With my vision starting to fail getting a clear iron sight alignment and a somewhat clear view of the target is tough.  With the Viper's red dot there is no problem.  Put the dot on the target and squeeze the trigger.  The Viper gets good marks.
Almost forgot - Dot size - the Viper says it has a 6 MOA dot - this translates to roughly 3/4"" at 38'  and about 1/2"" at 25'.  This is just about right for me - I can find the dot easily and get it on target quickly.  If you are red/green color blind -- too bad. stay with the iron sights."

I suspect the smaller tires are more difficult to mount that the bigger tires.  While I was never able to mount or remove these tires without tools, I have always been able to do the work by myself.  I use the blue plastic tire levers from Park Tool.

My rear tire currently has 3300 miles on it and needs to be replaced.  The black tread has been gone for some time now and the blue layer is peeking through in several places.  At this stage, the flat protection is not so good.  Over the weekend, I picked up a peice of glass that embedded itself in an area where the blue was exposed.  I was able to mount and unmount the tire quickly on the road using two of the blue tire levers.  However, it takes some practice to do this fast.

My front tire has the same mileage and still has full tread.

When the tires have their black outer rubber intact, I think the flat protection is great.  I can't say I never got a flat, but it took a nail or box-staple to penetrate the rubber.  I think these tires have spoiled me a bit.  I usually don't bother to avoid gravel or broken glass on my bike.  Overall, I have been very satisfied with this tire and just ordered the same tire to replace my rear tire."

The metal ring & the mounting position combine to provide an amazingly springy, unstable place to put your beverage.  Unless you are riding on a completely smooth surface (say, inside a gym), using a completely sealed container, this ""cup holder"" will magically transmit every defect in the road directly to your drink - gleefully flinging your beverage onto your bike, your clothes, people near you, etc.  If you should find a bump of any considerable size, the cup holder will get excited and throw your beverage AND your cup.  And that's in it's ""upright"" position, which is a temporary situation even on a good day.

Even with hand tools, you will not be able to tighten the cup holder enough.  After a few minutes of riding, the holder will begin to tilt downwards.  Even just a few ounces of drinky will be enough to work the holder into a tilted position.

If you have an empty cup you don't care about losing - this thing works great."

BUT, the string is attached to the center of the rest and at arrow height. The cord moving to different positions with each shot periodically hits the arrow or the fletching sending it off into the ground. Granted, I use FOBS but I could see it happening on regular vanes. Obviously this will not do on a hunt! Plus it's more than I want to put up with target shooting. On the better (of course more expensive) models, the string is attached to the end of the axle, to the right of the arrow about 2 inches and lower than the arrow, no problems. The rest I've found to work for me is the QAD Hunter for around fifty bucks, spend the money it's worth it because it also does more(see my review for 'Ultra Rest QAD Hunter').I bought this rest for my kids so I might try to remedy this with stiffer string material.? Update: I helped the problem by tying the cord to the cable guide. Simple: run the string trough the guide hole, adjust the length and burn the end of the cord. This pulls the cord away from the rest to the right, behind the trajectory of the arrow (in the case of a rt. handed bow). Seems to have done the trick so far."

Trust me I do not want to listen to his superior purchase over mine. Yes we are very competitive so if you can't beat them join them. I am impressed and the durability of these bags I have watched him throw his around both in the back of the pick up and on the riverbanks. The shoulder straps are nice for carrying them as well as securing them. A couple that went with us learned this the hard way on one of the times we tipped over.

(Beware of Seller changes! That's how you can get burned!)

:: PROS ::
1.)  Strong formula, meets the minimum levels for Bear Repellent.
2.)  Does not atomize in the wind, minimizes blow-back...looks like red silly string.
3.)  Better then a stun gun by far - NOT better then a Police Tazer though!
4.)  Burns badly and cannot be wiped off by attacker, minimal collateral damage to bystanders.
5.)  Large canister for the money - 50 Grams (Approximately 10 - 15 blasts max.)

:: CONS ::
1.)  Mine did not reach 18' (No wind at the time) went about 10 feet which is still better then Pepper Spray.
2.)  REALLY hard to remove from skin & clothes - so use it WISELY!!!
3.)  Holster is very tight so be sure to practice removing it a few times.

:: OVERALL :: GREAT personal defense weapon, better the Pepper Spray.  Make sure you know how to use it, if you spray yourself you're going to PAY for it.  Do not get it on your hands & throw away clothes that make contact with it.  My state allows for the use of both Pepper Gel & Stun Guns, so I recommend both - just remember the objective is ESCAPE not CLOSE COMBAT.  If you use this as an aggressor, you could face serious jail-time, it's a 'defense' weapon after-all ;)"

There's no way you are going to cook a gourmet meal for six on this thing, but you can boil water which can be used to rehydrate freeze-dried meals (Mountain House, for example) or coffee/tea. When you are tired, wet and cold there's nothing like a hot drink or some warm food in your stomach to make life seem more bearable, and this little stove will deliver the goods.  The fuel tablets are very expensive, and how many you use will depend on wind. In strong wind, you'll need about 10 to boil a cup of water; in still air you can usually accomplish the same thing with 3 tablets. But obviously supplementing the fuel tablets with dry wood helps cut down on the speed with which you'll have to break out new white cubes.  Using wood to supplement the fire will also cut down on the oily residue you'll find on the outside of your cup or canteen, though soot will of course be there instead.

I keep one of these (and 24 fuel tablets) in my backpack at all times - it weighs very little and, even with the extra fuel tablets, doesn't take up much space. But it's not a red-hot, cook-anything apparatus so be aware that this is for the ""better than hard routine"" lifestyle, not for the ""camp in comfort"" brigade."

The putter's handle comes in 3 pieces that are easy to assemble - just screw them together then screw the putting head onto the end. When broken down each piece is held inside the zippered case with a thick piece of elastic. One golf ball is included and once you install the batteries you can take this along anywhere for a quick practice session. The zippered case is small enough to be stored in the car,...or desk drawer. :)

On a rug or low carpet this works very nice,...wood floors weren't as much fun. On our wood floor when the ball came out of the ball return it shot out very quickly. When we set it on the rug it was easier to play and we didn't have to chase the ball around as much. This is fun and easy to use and the kids would have just as much fun playing with it as an adult would.

The red color is bright and fun, and the mat is plenty sticky for me. I still need a towel on it the second I get sweaty, but I literally need one for all the mats I've used. It's a lot lighter than my full-size mat, so I don't mind. In regards to what another commenter said, I don't have a fancy Yogitoes towel, either. I mean, $50 for a yoga towel? Really!? So I just use a regular travel towel, and that works great on this mat, especially since the towel also provides a little extra padding. I'm lucky enough to go to a yoga school that has spare mats in every studio, so I've layered this one over the studio mats when I've been feeling sore (see: teacher training) and need even more padding. It never budges during practice, whether it's on the floor by itself or layered. Like I said: definitely a sticky mat. There is so much versatility on how to carry this mat; it can be folded flat or rolled any number of ways. Then when I unroll or unfold it, it still lays perfectly flat on the floor! Going to and from class, I prefer to fold it in half horizontally, then roll it up. Then it can be carried like any regular mat... just a very thin, light one! Highly recommend if you're not too picky about needing the extra padding. In a pinch, I fold over the edges of this mat (towel and all) to pad my knees. It is thin if you have cranky joints, but in my experience it's perfectly fine with a blanket under the knees or on carpet. Namaste :)"

At the time I only had a heavy downhill bike and a old hardtail. I was unable to travel to to any parks or trails to make use of my DH rig and my hardtail was no longer safe for my aggressive trail riding. At the time I took on a new job and could not justify spending 1000+ on another bike however I was craving some good trail riding. Prior to this purchase I had never been on a 27.5 bike before, so after hearing all the hype I was very eager to check things out myself. This was the only complete 650b I found under $1000 (and at the time this was under 600). I jumped on it and decided I would give it a go and that I could always resell if I wasn't happy. The bike came in partially assembled and with all the remaining parts organized in the box. After completing the build and tightening all screws, bolts, etc. I hopped on and started pedaling. My first impression was how snappy and responsive the bike was. It felt very sturdy and well built. The most surprising part to me was the geometry, I was immediately a fan. At 5'9 I feel very comfortable and in control in the cockpit. 6 or so months of riding and a few upgrades later I can give a very honest summary of my expletive thus far. Don't ever trust the stock mechanical brakes. These tjings are dangerous and should not come stock on even the cheapest department store bike. Upgrade to any type of hydraulic system immediately. Throw out the pedals and get something that will keep you on the bike. The stock pedals work only for riding along in a flat parking lot. The rear shock will have to go and some point as well. The coil shock is completely bottom of the bucket when we're talking rear suspension. There's no control and always seems too stiff and too quick to respond. Though the front fork is very much a budget system as well, it does have some minor adjusting capabilities and soaks up a lot trail nicely. The remaining pieces of the system here are what you should be expecting for the price range with a couple of surprises. The stock Kenda tires are some of my favorite I have ever ridden, the wheels the tires go on are stylish and have no issues taking on rough terrain, and I also enjoy the steer-ability the wide handlebars provide. Cranks, drive train, etc are heavy and nothing exciting. They do the job but do leave you wanting more."

I will definately buy more in the future.  It has a few oddities when compared to normal paracord but they are unavoidable/acceptable due to the nature of what this cord can do. For example as you might immagine the wire and the twine don't melt...which makes fusing the ends harder. But that is an acceptable oddity due to the fact tha this cord can do far more than your normal cord.

  It is a bit tricky to work with doing crafts and such because of the extra cords.  None of those extra 3 like to bend or hold shape as well as the nylons cords do, but if you work at it you CAN get the cord to look like any other belt, bracelet, etc. you just have to have to pull on it more and have more patience.

The casing around the cord is a tiny bit loose...but I realized why when I tried to remove JUST the fishing line.  If you tie the other 8 strands down or clamp down on them with pliers at one end...then pull on the fishing line at the other end I succeeded in pulling out the fishing line alone without removing the other 8 strands.  Only tried this with an 8 foot piece however (roughly the size of a paracord bracelet) and it worked.

Those are the 3 oddities or ""cons"" you might say of this cord...but i find them acceptable due to how well it works.  The snare wire is shockingly strong.  The fact it doesn't burn comes in handy later on if you use it for things like cooking.  Only tested it out on a test snare not to actuallly catch anything but it seems like it should hold up against most small game.  The fishing line is just as you might expect.  Play with it and figure out your ideal syste for how to pull it out without pulling out all 9 strands with the ""tools you have in bug out bag mode"" and I am sure you will appreciate having that extra line.  As for the waxed twine...wow!  Never seen anything light that easily.  Pull it apart make a birds next and it ignights with the first spark.  Be ready though...it burns so fast and so easy you will have to start over if you don't have it positioned right with the other branches and twigs and what not standing by.

Well worth the purchase.  They have another 100' haunch I wanna buy that has...if you can believe it EVEN MORE benefits.  A new orange band that does not only all of this...but has reflective fibers AND glow in the dark fibers woven into the outer sheath!  Its already on their site but I gonna wait and buy it when it shows up here on amazon.

((Only downside to this company at all is they do kind of repeatedly send you emails to rate their product.  But...their customer service is pretty good if you email them back asking them questions...so had I asked they might have stopped.))"

The pump has a Schrader head (the kind you find on cars and many bikes), but includes a Presta adapter (much thinner--you'll know if you have these valves, often found on road bikes). It also includes a ""pin"" adapter for things like basketballs and small plastic nozzle-type thing for some inflatables. I have not used these last two adapters, so I cannot vouch for them, but I have used the pump on both Schrader and Presta valves.

The gauge goes up to 120 psi, but the box claims it can only do 100 psi (although the product description here claims 120 as of my writing this). Having used it, I suspect that even 100 psi is a bit generous for the max. Despite this claim, I still have an incredibly difficult time getting above about 70 psi (even when I use both my legs to press, or even my whole body--but be careful since the pump is slightly fragile); it tends to ""leak"" air out the valve with the pump attached. However, even at lower pressures it becomes increasingly difficult to pump. This probably won't be a problem for balls or mountain bikes, but for higher-pressure tires like road bikes and some hybrids, it might be a lot of work or even impossible to go as high as it claims.

Also, this was my first time using Presta valves, and I had never used a Presta adapter before. Everybody besides me probably knows this, but there are no directions, and I was confused at first. The proper way is to screw the Presta adapter onto the Presta valve first, then attach the pump to *the adapter on the valve* just as if it were a Schrader valve. (I thought the adapter was for the pump. It is easy to attach it to the pump fist but difficult or impossible to then attach it to the valve.) Again, everyone probably knows this, but I thought I'd say it in case it helps out anyone else.

In summary: this pump is OK, but don't expect road-bike-like high pressures with ease. It's easier to pump than a frame/hand pump but less portable (so probably not something you'd take with for emergencies). If you're using a road bike or even a hybrid, you'll probably be better off with a floor pump. I'm sure it's fine for balls and such and probably many mountain bikes, but pumping my hybrid was rarely an easy experience, and I'm sure my road bike would have been impossible--and the manufacturer's claims about pressure are clearly inflated.

EDIT: After having this pump for several months and trying to inflate tires on my hybrid bike, the pump broke. The metal pieces connecting the pedal to the pump are a bit thin, and they are what broke. I suspect it was the high pressure. I want to reiterate that this pump cannot handle high pressures, and I would probably recommend a floor pump instead. Still, this pump may be OK for mountain bikes or low-pressure needs like balls."

My son likes to ride his bike to his friends houses each day.  He's not old enough to drive but does need to take things along like his cell phone, gaming device, iPad, etc.  He usually puts them in a plastic grocery bag that he loops over the handle bars. It swings and blows as he rides away and I cringe, just waiting for his favorite and most expensive things to fall on the ground.  This bike bag is the answer to my worries.  He was so excited when I showed it to him.  He immediately took it outside and easily attached it to his bike.  He's only 10 and he did it with ease so installation is very simple.  The velcro straps seem to adhere well and they don't jiggle or loosen. I also like that there is a bag on each side of the bar...so two bags total.  He's already trying to decide how much he can fit in each side.  The bag is waterproof as well which will come in handy if anything gets left outside in the rain while he's hanging out with his buddies or riding around town.  The bag is padded and  provides some shock absorption if he gets rough with his bike or falls off for some reason.  Even though it's padded, it's not bulky and didn't get in the way of him riding his bike as usual.  This bike frame bag is the one thing I never knew we needed so much.  I would definitely recommend this product.

1. The knife is very slim and compact making it very convenient to carry and light weight.
2. The knife came with a perfectly shaving sharp edge right out of the box.  Not a deal breaker if it wasn't, but it's always great to see a company go that extra step!
3. The sheath seems durable and offers multiple lashing points. The lashing points are also large enough to fit standard 550 para cord through without issue, which I have found can be a problem, especially with CRKT sheaths in the past such as the Ritter RSK MK5 neck knife.
4. The knife provides a nice streamlined design and construction allowing for maximum sanitary value, and the easy ability to wipe the knife down with rubbing alcohol for food prep. There is simply no place for bacteria to harbor on a skeletonized design like this.
5. All gripping corners, including the spine have been beautifully rounded off to provide no hot spots or sharp edges, making the knife very comfortable in the hand (for a skeletonized knife at least... more on that later).
6. The knife comes right out of the box with an included lanyard for extra retention giving the user just a bit more to grab onto and provide better purchase when using such a diminutive knife.
7. The primary and secondary grinds on my particular example were spot on.  No uncentered or uneven grinds.
8. The simple design of the blade shape lends itself to being extremely simple to sharpen.  No dual grinds or negative angles to deal with here.
9. The edge geometry is designed for maximum slicing ability and has a nice delicate, fine edge.  The edge geometry was well thought out and well executed in my opinion.
10. The steel quality, while certainly not the best, is completely adequate for the style of knife, and I see no problems with edge holding ability with regards to the ""intended"" use that this knife was designed for.  That being said, your mileage may vary!
11. The skeletonized handle design does lend itself to being able to be wrapped with para cord if you so choose, although I wouldn't recommend it, as cord wraps are extremely unsanitary in my honest opinion especially if you plan to use this knife to skin game or for food prep.

The Bad:

1.  I have noticed after carrying this knife and using it everyday for a few months that the retention has loosened a bit.  This does give me some reservations as to how well the retention will hold up long term.  The rentention is already at a point where I'm soon going to worry about the knife possibly falling out of the sheath if bumped or knocked around too hard while carrying it in a neck carry fashion.
2. This is a skeletonized knife, and as such, the buyer needs to keep in mind that it's just that; a ""skeletonized knife""!  Skeletonized knives rank about a 0 on a scale of 1-10 in comfort.  The lack of proper handle scales makes these type of knives extremely uncomfortable in the hand and nearly impossible to use in any other fashion than a pinch grip (similar to using a scalpel or box opener).  Not being able to use other extremely useful knife grips like a hammer grip and saber grip extremely limits the overall usefulness of the knife.  This basically reduces the knife to nothing more than a glorified (and oversized) scalpel.  So don't intend on using this knife to carve wood, or do any other task that requires a bit of force in cutting. While skeletonized knives are designed for convenience of carry, it's at the cost of extreme discomfort in the hand, and limitation of usefulness as a result!  Just something to keep in mind.
3. This knife is a 2.5 fingered grip. (I will provide numerous pictures and size references with this review).  Once again, while skeletonized knives (and knives of this size) are designed for convenience of carry, it's at the cost of extreme discomfort in the hand, and limitation of usefulness as a result!  Just something to keep in mind.
4. Overall, while this knife is well made, and the price point is decent, I just felt underwhelmed with is overall usefulness.  There are just too many cases where the poor ergonomics and skeletonized design became a hindrance.

Conclusion:

While the knife's price and overall quality were good, skeletonized knives just don't do it for me!  Their extreme lack of comfort and proper ergonomics just makes them extremely annoying and unsavory to use on a regular basis.  They are also very limited in their overall ability because of this.  Finally, I also had some reservations about how well the sheath retention would hold up in the long run before the knife could possibly begin to start falling out.
So, would I recommend this knife? Honestly, yes I would with a STRONG caveat!  If you are the type of person that pretty much only uses a knife to open boxes or envelopes, then you are probably going to be fine.  However, if you are the type of person that needs a knife to cut wire, and carve wood and other harder cutting chores, then this (and honestly ANY skeletonized knife) is NOT for you!"

We did however do some modifications and upgrades. We installed a new sight, string silencers, peep, etc. and it was all worth it. I like the fact that you can make the modifications to the draw length without needing a bow press, that was a plus. We have the bow set at approx. 40 Ibs which is enough to be effective on our deer hunt and still gives her the ability to add some poundage. I don't think we will get to the point where we max out but remember you shouldn't substitute strength of accuracy. I will let everyone know how the hut goes but I am very please with this purchase and would definitely do it again. Great job Bear!"

I really don't want to give this a bad review as I am not using it as it was intended. I do think that $16.95 is a bit steep for these. It's worth about half of that.

I got this and have only two complaints really.  First, the good as it seems sturdy enough for my uses which is really just moving a utility trailer around the yard. I could find another reason to use it but as it stands nothing yet. Now for the bad. I had a grab bar installed on my golf cart but I had to remove it because the holes from the hitch didn't line up with the grab bar. I'm not sure why since its suppose to be a universal hitch. At any rate, it is what it is. Next was the rattling the receiver makes when driving the golf cart. However, that goes along with any trailer hitch and receiver so that complaint really doesn't hold water in my book. I still like the hitch but hate I had to remove my grab bar."

The main compartment is smaller than I hoped, and the bag overall is smaller than it looks in pictures.  I managed to easily connect what took too much room inside the bag to the outside using the various hooks and straps.  I connected my sleeping bag to the top straps, sleeping mat horizontally across the top above my sleeping bag, than attached various tools and canteens etc around where they could fit.  Haven't tried in rain yet, but the zippers all seem relatively protected by overlap fabric which should keep the insides dry.

A lot of options, but perhaps a bit overwhelming if you plan to just pack stuff inside for hiking.  There are sooooo many zippers, compartments, straps, hooks, loops, it is almost confusing to pack and get to stuff quickly.  Overall pretty nice for the price.

Also this is orange, I kinda thought it looked more yellow in the picture, maybe that was just on my laptop screen I used to order it."

Even on the lowest setting we had sufficient light to see everything just fine. But when the fire finally died down is when I really noticed how bright this light is!!

We took it out for a 4 day weekend stay and had a great time with it.  We had hard rain, 20-25 mph winds and 39 degree temps!!  The tent held up just great.  However, this tent is not for cold weather!!  Had 2 small propane heaters going and it barely made a difference.  The entire top of the tent is netting which will be great for this summer in the desert of S central Az.  The light which comes with the tent is really quite good, don't need 150W out in the middle of nowhere!  Needless to say, we didn't use the fan!  We really love this tent and it had a real work out.  Roomy, my oh my we have a lot of room in this tent and can stand up in it and walk around, along with a Q size air bed!  Can't go wrong with this one!!"

A nice touch would've been adding rubber feet to the product. I have hardwood floors, so it sort of slides around. Perhaps it'll work better on a carpeted surface.

It is 23 3/4"" long, and the angle bends in at 75-degrees.

It is well made ! Time will tell on durability, however I expect
it to hold up great!  The inside is made with nylon and well seamed.
It  wipes out easily. It has lots of compartments and is not hard to
view into like the Gym bag I was using.

CONS: Upon receiving it mine did need to be aired out as it had a chemical smell that quickly dissipated.
It does have embroidery on it that says Mud River Dog Products. This may bother someone who wants
to buy it for use other than dog training. Otherwise I say go for it!

There is plenty of room for my dogs toys and training tools.
The only draw back SO FAR, is it is SO nice I will have to keep an eye
on it so it does not somehow ""walk off by itself"" at dog events. Am going
to put a luggage tag on it. It holds A LOT of stuff and would be costly to loose.

Will Update this review IF I find anything I don't like about it later on.
Hope this helps YOU decide on this purchase.

UPDATE: Aug 2012. OK, this bag is holding up nicely just as I had expected.
The only design change that I would like to see, should the company redesign later,
is for it to open with a large snap or clasp, instead of the zipper. A magnetic clasp would be great.
The  Dr. Bag design with the hinges so it opens wide is appreciated, but not having to use the long zipper
every time it is opened would be more convenient.  ;D"

This set is designed for a 10 Man Flag Football game.  It includes 5 Red Flag Belts, 5 Yellow Flag Belts, 4 Goal Line Cones, and 1 Orange Drawstring Storage Bag.

The Drawstring Storage Bag is made to be carried like a backpack so if you're traveling with this football set or bringing it to a party than you can conveniently carry all of the pieces hands free!

The Flag Belts are made of a strong nylon webbing with a D-ring closure.  Very easy to put on and won't be yanked off (like some cheaper Velcro closure belts I've used in other flag football games).  The sizing says these belts will fit most.  I'd say they're right - there's a lot of slack on mine and I'm an average size.  These belts adjust easily for the ideal fit for you.

Each belt has two flags of the same color that are attached by a strip of Velcro.  The Velcro is strong enough for the flag to stay on while running around, yet not so strong that they are impossible to get off.

The four cones are very bright orange so they are super easy to see and are made of a lightweight flexible plastic.  Easy to travel with and clean up quick before packing them back up.

This is a nice quality set that will be put to great use this summer!

For those who haven't played flagged football in a while or ever this set comes with a few basic ways to run the game.

The field is typically 60 yards long by 25 yards wide and can easily be marked with the four included cones.

You can play with 4-5 players oneach team with this set.  The directions give some information on starting the game, starting a down, first downs, when the play is dead, scoring and length of the game.

Hope you enjoy this as much as my family does! Great way to bond, have some laughs and get a good workout in with friends and family!

My company does not sell filtering bottles, but I have tried them from many companies, given their popularity and practicality.

Brita's filtering bottles have taken the industry by storm, mostly due to their marketing investment and broad distribution, but they look terrible (like a biking bottle), and they are made from a soft, semi-opaque plastic that I think looks really cheap.  Further, because Brita bottles are not clear, it is hard to tell if you are really getting them clean when it comes time to wash them.

Then there are the Bobble bottles.  Like Brita's bottle, the Bobble is cheap--under $10.  However, it is far better than Brita's bottle.  It has a curvy, youthful styling to it, and you get a new cap and nozzle every time you buy a replacement filter.  If you want, you can choose a different color of cap and filter whenever you buy a replacement filter for your Bobble bottle.  Good luck washing your Bobble bottle in the dishwasher.  Given its shape, you will never get it clean in there.  Consider it a hand-wash-only option.

On the higher end, there is the Camelbak Groove, which retails for around $25 at the mass merchant whose logo looks like a bullseye.  Made of rigid Tritan polyester/plastic, the Camelbak bottle has a substantial feel to it.  It is well engineered.  It has a soft-touch, flip-up mouthpiece, and the carbon-based filter is actually in the straw.  Hence, you suck the water through the straw to filter.

Then, there is the Gobie bottle.  There is so much to like about the Gobie.  First it is made in the USA.  When it comes to things made of plastic, I feel better knowing that it is made here.  Beyond that, Gobie is a real work of art.  It looks great and functions perfectly and uniquely.  It is unique in several regards.  First, it combines a rigid Tritan polyester bottle design with a squeezable diaphragm (the blue part) on the side of the bottle, which allows you to squeeze water out of your Gobie, rather than having to suck it out, like the Camelbak bottle.  Second, the unique air vent system on the Gobie gets rid of the gurgling sound you will get when drinking from a Brita or Bobble bottle.  When you drink from the Gobie, you only hear air coming into the bottle through the tiny silicone valve that is built into the side of the bottle.  Ingenious.  Next, there is the soft-touch finger loop and soft, grippy bottom on the bottle, which make for excellent ergonomics and handling.  The finger loop doubles as a holder for the cap that covers the drinking nozzle.  When you take off the cap, you can insert it into the finger loop.  It fits perfectly, and it was designed that way.

Sure, the Gobie will cost you a few extra bucks, but if you are serious about kicking the bottled water habit, this investment will pay for itself in no time.  Alternatively, you could look like an old fuddy duddy with your Brita bottle or like you are stuck in midlife crisis with your Bobble bottle.  Camelbak would be a fine choice for many, but it doesn't say you are a free thinker, somebody who will choose features and design over a big brand like Camelbak.  Someday, the Gobie might be a really big brand, and you can say, ""I bought one back when they were just getting started."""

To give you a little background, I am a 200 lbs plus guy. My hobby is endurance racing. (Not to win, just to finish!) ha ha. So I ride long and hard, both mountain and road. This saddle went on my Road Bike.  The great thing, other than pure comfort, is this is a custom saddle.  This saddle has a down turned nose and an up turned back.  This allows you to ride forward while climbing and sit back while cranking down the road or single track.  Very comfy. This saddle came factory installed on my Breezer Supercell Team Full Suspension bike. I read others online talk about the all day ride quality of this bike and saddle. They were absolutely correct. I can ride on this saddle all day.  Normally I change out my factory saddle, but not this time. Still loving it!  You can order it in three widths, and many different levels such as CroMo rails, or Carbon Fiber rails.  Kind of nice having a company let you order the size and level of the saddle.  This is also an incredibly durable saddle. Been riding this now for 2 years on my full suspension mountain bike, and it still looks and feels great.  I ride a lot, so that is a great quality. I really love this saddle. Only thing I would remind you of, saddles are very personal, and just because I love this saddle, does not mean you will too.  I would not hesitate to order this saddle.  Happy riding!"

The gun looks good, feels good, the scope is quite nice.  It is extremely accurate and a lot of fun but I have 2 significant disappointments that would have directed me to a different rifle maker.  1) The clip design.  It won't except BBs.  Well, they will accept SOME BBs while the rest fall straight through.  Pellets load fine but for some reason steel BBs like to slip through the holes, so it's useless for BBs.  2)  The Co2 mechanism.  The positive thing is it is a safe mechanism.  Unfortunately my gun wastes a vast amount of Co2, pellgun oil or no pellgun oil.  When you load it, no matter how swift and crisp you penetrate and tighten down the cartridge, most of the time you have to listen to the gun hissing out the Co2.  In my experience, I have often had to shoot up the cartridge right away and still end up with only 25 to 35 shots.  It's unfortunate because it is a lot of fun to shoot, just kind of a hissing gas hog."

My bike has eyelets and screw holes for a mount such as this. I was able to use some of them, but I still had to bend the basket slightly (my frame was too wide) and makeshift my own solution. It was not easy, and it left some scratches on the frame. Once installed, however, the basket is great.

So far this inexpensive unit performs extremely well. For a basic unit its as good or better than other units costing much more.  Mounting was easy, (it comes with reusable tie wraps, very handy if you have to move/adjust components after install, or move everything to another bike).  The setup directions are pretty straight forward as these things go (the very logical tire size selection chart can be altered slightly for exact speed calibration, but its pretty accurate at book values).  As for quality, it seems to be built as well as most devices made in China.

In short, I like this thing... I ride 10-35 miles a day, so when on a spare bike I really miss not seeing speed/distance when its not there. Since these are so inexpensive and accurate I ordered a couple more for my spare bikes. One of my spare bikes is going to go on an indoor training bike lash up (for when I cant ride outdoors) so the sensor has to be on the rear forks...  It worked out OK but a very tricky install (the sensor cable is designed for a front tire install, and the cable is ""just"" barely long enough to reach the rear forks with enough play left over for the handlebars to move as they must). ** a more expensive unit had even shorter cables and was not worth trying to mount on rear forks.

*** note you can find an on line manual by searching for ""bell dashboard 100 PDF""...  (much easier to read before or after you get one of these)"

It's sort of like wrapping your head in a thick piece of carpet... but in a good way LOL.

Well made, good-looking, it smelled a bit of mothballs when first opened (a tribute to its legit pre-soviet breakup heritage), and it was a bit smaller than I thought it would be. Normally that would be an issue, but the ushanka.com website has instructions for both stretching and shrinking their hats, and they work pretty well. So I'm happy!

This adidas-branded weight bench comes disassembled and ships to you in a very large box. The box arrived with some holes in it. Inside the parts were all taped or bagged together, though some of the pieces had paint dings and chips from banging around in transit. When you first open the box, there is a strong chemical smell, so your assembly will be more pleasant if you work in a well-ventilated area. Also, some of the pieces had sand or welding flashing left inside, which rattled around.

The kit comes with two needed Allen keys, but you will need to provide your own wrench. The manual has an exploded diagram with numbers for the various nuts, bolts, and washers. One of the diagrams was incorrectly labeled -- I was able to figure it out however. One person can put it together by themselves, but it will go more quickly with two people. Plan on an hour or two to get everything together.

The weight capacity is 500# -- that includes the person --> plenty for me. The welds seem strong and the equipment stable.

The best feature is the wide support arms, which allow you to use an Olympic-sized bar. You can grip as wide as you want and there is plenty of room.

Some other features include:

* Adjustable rack mounts, with numbered holes so you can easily adjust the heights of both sides.

* Safety rails

* Adjustable backrest and seat.

* Cushions that give firm, comfortable support.

One item to note however is that the ""flat"" setting is not really flat. The seat cushion is about an inch higher than the head cushion, so you are actually on a slight decline in the ""flat"" setting.

All in all, this weight bench works well for me. I find it very functional, robust, and I love the room it gives me. Note however, that this is probably not a weight bench for the professional gym or pro athlete -- first, this won't give you a flat bench. Second, if you weigh more than 200 or 250 pounds, you will likely be benching more than that, which will put you over the safety rating of this equipment. But if you are a home user who wants to take their health and fitness to the next level, then this will likely be a great bench for you.

I hope you found this review helpful."

People who have fogging issues, one fix I found from scuba divers is (1) (gently...don't scratch the lens) rub 1 drop of baby shampoo in the goggles and then rinse them with running water (till you don't see bubbles) then you're good to go.  If they fog up when you put them on after this, then just dunk them once in the pool/lake (to acclimate to the temp of the water) then they will not fog up again for that swim (maybe two swims). At least this is my experience.  And yes, you have to apply and rinse baby shampoo each time you swim.  (2) The night before, rub a drop of baby shampoo in each lens and just rinse before swimming the next day or later.  In my experience, for some reason this 2nd method isn't as good as the 1st since they seem to eventually fog up on me for longer swims.  Go online and do some research on baby shampoo and goggles and you might find better methods.  But these are simple and WORK!"

The gloves are very nice-looking and made a strong material that appears to be very durable.  The gloves have an adjustable strap on them that makes it easier to fit a variety of hands.  The gloves have padding on the inside palm and hand area with a gel type fabric.  This makes it nice when you're holding onto your bike the pads come in very handy after a long bike ride.  It is nice to have the pads there so your hands don't get hurt or injured from the pressure on them. On the top of the gloves there is a netting and type of fabric let's your hand and skin breve while you have the gloves on.  When biking I often sweat, it's a good workout so it's nice to have a breathing area for my hands so they are not trapped inside a glove. The only thing I would change about these gloves is it is a little rough on my skin on the inside top part of my hand. However I am very used to it now so it is not a problem. I received a discount on this product in a special promotion. My review, my opinion and experience is honest and 100% genuine."

The padding is slightly off-center and in a weird place, but it doesn't affect the function I'm looking for.  It's also nice not to grip cold weight in my garage anymore.

These from Cressi seem like quality, respectable - yet still fun - fins that are just the right size compared to her height. Before I realized what she was doing, she had removed the fins from the packaging, taken out the shape-protecting inserts, donned and tightened the fins all on her own. She wears a size 12/13 shoe and her entire foot fits on the base of the size S/M fin. While the straps can be tightened enough to keep her feet securely inside, there is quite a bit of strap hanging out on either side, but they don't seem to hinder her movements in any way. There are buttons on the sides of the fins to loosen the straps as needed, whether to make removal easier or to readjust for sizing as feet grow.

My daughter said the fins feel heavy when swimming underwater, even more so then her Fin Fun Mermaid Tail, but that could be due to the difference of two legs working together vs. not.  These fins are also longer than her mono-fin. She also said these Pretty in Pink fins are colorful, pretty, very helpful, and make her swim faster.  Mission accomplished."

I bough this because I needed a cheap reel for my Penn Prevail 9ft rod for the surf.  This seem like an ideal reel since it is suppose to be light weight and also good against the elements.  I got the 5000 series and spooled it with 15# mono and loaded it up on my Penn and boy was that thing heavy.  I took it out for a few sessions and after about an hour or two my arm got tired.  It is heavier than my Penn Fierce II.

After one session a week ago in the surf where it dunked it a few times and had dropped it in the sand it seem like it had no issues.  I took it home and then washed it off with water to get all the salt water and sand off.  It seemed fine but then as I started to crank the handle, I felt resistance as before the session when it was smooth like butter.  I guess that session had put a toll on the reel.  I am going to take it apart to re-grease and oil it to see if that improves.  I am hoping it will be back to it's original state of reeling like butter.

Overall it is a good reel, I wouldn't mind purchasing it again."

I spent the better part of the ride moving the pannier into an upright position.

Today, I arranged to return the ArcEnCiel pannier to Amazon, with many thanks going to Amazon for their fantastic return policy.

Pros: This pannier is small enough to stay out of the way, but large enough to hold a compact handgun and an ID; it securely holds a cellphone or an iPod Classic; it didn't interfere with the brake and shift cables.

Cons: Rather than remaining in an upright position, it continually slides 15 to 20 degrees to one side, even with the affixed Velcro straps fully tightened around the bike frame, and the elastic band secured around the handlebar stem; the traction base didn't provide sufficient traction to hold the pannier in place; the clear plastic touch screen didn't work with my iPod Classic."

I have a Fitted Medium HeatGear shirt that is loose on me.  I took the advice of other reviewers that said this Semi Fitted shirt is very loose and bought a small.  I'm glad I went down a size because it fits exactly how I wanted my Fitted shirt to feel!  Close to the body and long in length.  So the lesson I learned: if you want a true SEMI FITTED feel, buy a Fitted shirt in your normal size.  If you want a FITTED shirt, buy a semi-fitted and go down one size!"

There's no way I can picture more than four adults in this tent, and even then, I'd think they'd have to be two couples. For just me, there's plenty of spare room, even with a queen air mattress.

It set up very quickly and easily. The instructions are so tiny, I couldn't read them even with my reading glasses, but it didn't matter. The tent went right up in an obvious way. It would help to put the words ""front"", ""side"", and ""rear"" on the rain fly edges, but it's not that big a deal.

I used it with the rain fly, and also, out under the stars in the mountains without the rain fly, and it was great both ways. The little pockets and lantern hanger are nice touches.

The one caveat is that it's almost impossible to get the tent back into the carry bag. In the field, I gave up and just stuffed it into the back of my car. When I got home, I cleared an area of floor big enough, and carefully stretched it out and folded it. With a lot of care, it just barely fit back into the carry bag. So make sure you plan ahead for that.

But I like the tent and I'm sticking with it."

That said it is super comfortable, and looks pretty nice as well. It has a strap that can tighten the hood around you head so it won't blow off, and the wrists don't have any elastic which keeps you a bit less sweaty. It seems well put together and has stood up to several washings so far.

I am sore all over, which means the DvD is doing its job-- no pain no gain! I would recommend this to anyone who has motivation problems and stay more focused with someone telling  you how to workout rather than doing it all yourself.

Good luck!

*My update- I am now almost 2 weeks into Insanity. It's been hard, but I've dieted and exercised every day. I started out at 210-212 and now am 205! I can't really SEE results yet, but I do notice my stomach is smaller! I have done no other exercises than Insanity, and have been very very sore, especially my legs. You can see the exact same results if you DIET and EXERCISE like I am. Diet is king and exercise is Queen, together you have a kingdom! You NEED TO DO BOTH to see results. My friends please stay motivated, more updates to come in about 2 weeks."

- This will only fit correctly (""without rattling"" as the noobs like to call it) on a 16"" barrel AR platform with a mid-length handguard, and a muzzle device (break, etc.) that conforms to the A2 birdcage design - ie, it has to have the birdcage bayonet ring in the correct spot for this to ""not rattle"".  In addition, you obviously need the A2 front sight-post with bayonet lug.
This will likely also work on a rifle length gas system AR, but i cannot confirm that personally.
What this will NOT work on is a civilian carbine-length gas system AR.  Why?  Because civilian models have at least a 16"" barrel by law (not talking SBR here), and the carbine length gas system and handguard creates a setup where there is far too much ""barrel"" in front of the handguard and front sight post for this to fit correctly.  You will end up with the blade barely passing the end of the barrel, and it will also ""rattle"".  This is not a problem for our troops, because their M4 carbines have 14.5"" barrels - allowing the proper clearances and alignment to use a bayonet on a carbine length handguard upper.

The only detail I haven't seen mentioned that really did affect our camping was that these give a very lateral/horizontal light, and thus are quite difficult to cook, wash etc while hung, as you are not receiving direct light. They sort of leave a big shadow below them. I fiddled with them for quite a while until I ended up hanging bungy cords on the ceiling so that I could then tie them up horizontally, which allowed the light to shine directly down. They are definitely useful for 90% of camping, but I will be supplementing with their other hanging, down firing, rechargeable unit.
The only other thing I would ad, I know the cool 6000k light is all the craze these days with LEDs, but I would much prefer the qualities of the warmer 3000-4000k light, just more pleasing to me. Heck, thats what we all lived with since the bulb was invented. Still a good product."

I'm also impressed with how it keeps my hands warm in cold conditions.  I have purchased about a 1/2 dz of them since my first purchase.  I've given them as gifts to my family & friends, who also rave about them.  I play winter golf, and these saved my hands/fingers during really cold rounds.

My daughter's family used them for baseball (playing/watching), camping out and other outdoor activities.  They especially like how well it charged their phones, iPads or other USB devices.

I also like the size, easy to put in pockets (buy 2), or jackets.

NOTE:  the warmer has 3 settings for heat.  I suggest using the lowest setting (1-light), which leads to reducing battery life.  The lowest setting is great for your bare hands.  Also, if children are using them, be sure to check that the warmer is turned off completely when not in use (holding down the white button under all the warming lights go off), turns the warmer off.  I've seen where a kid selected the highest warming setting (3-lights), and didn't turn it off.  They put the warmer in a jacket & forgot it was there.  Their parent checked the pockets & found the warmer (which they turned off).  I don't think the warmer would get so hot as to cause a fire, but it may melt something like plastic or rubber, and cause a mess or worse."

The lid was a little pricey as everyone seemed to sold out after Christmas.  I paid almost double the price because I didn't know the Yeti web sales site had them for $4.99.

11139,1975,Female,193000,777.5575756400109,No,Yes,Northeast,NJ,5,"03 21, 2016","Of the ""rumble"" roller style of foam rollers, this is probably my favorite","Very dense ""rumble"" style roller that does it's job great. Personally, I carry two style of rollers with me at all times, one being your typical flat surface, high density roller and the other..... well this one now. As such, it's important that these roller are travel sized, which this one is, and light enough to keep attached to my gym duffel. I usually use my flat surfaced roller to warm my self in preparation for some deep myofascial release with this roller. For some, a roller style like this one might be a little much if you are not used to it, but once you realized how effective this roller is it'll be hard to go back to those pillow-like white rollers you see at your typical globo gym.

Some of my past ""rumble"" style rollers had blocky ridges or varied sized ridges which seemed like a good idea but ultimately were not as useful in my opinion. Being able to have a consistent surface with individual equally spaced spaced bumps allowed me to settle into my self massage a lot easier because I didn't have to worry about repositioning the roller over and over again. The rounded bumps made this both more punishing (in a good way) yet more forgiving at the same time. I know that may not make much sense, but once you try it you will know what I mean.

Ultimately, a good foam roller or two is probably one of the best fitness investments you can make for yourself. Forget about that fancy color coordinated dry fit shirt or your brand name head band and grab this foam roller. Those things will not keep you injury free nor will they help you recover more efficiently so that you can hit your workouts harder and more often. Would you rather be strong and mobile or gym-fab?

I installed it and oh wow, it worked great and was well worth the wait.  After a week of using it, it started spitting bullets on every load and became more of a pain to try to use.  I took it off.

I have made a couple of modifications that should have been done at the factory. The tent doesn't close at the bottom so some Velcro seals out the breeze between the mattress and tent bottom. The holes for the tent poles were a little small on the cot so needed to be drilled out. The cot weighs too much so will eventually swap out for a lighter one. This makes for a great motorcycle set up but a shorter lighter cot is necessary. The pillow was tossed. Get a soft compact one instead. Will have to see how it holds up after a week of camping at different locations every night. May be a little iffy on rainy nights.

Definitely worth the money to track Calories burned/HR  and separately sync with a phone App. Batterly life is 7+ days if you're only using it for time and exclusively for workout/heart rate/calories burned a few times a week. Stand alone time, not working out and only wearing it is probably 2 weeks, charging is a breeze with adapter it comes with. Also, if you rapidly shake your  wrist twice back light turns on, comes in handy when you're running at night and want to peek at HR or if you wake up in the middle of the night and want to see the time. It's not a pretty smart apple watch, but I wouldn't wear a $150+ watch at the gym. No need to be texting and answering calls if I'm working out.

In addition, as I looked at the aerodynamics of my seat tube & down tube cages, it appeared that they were creating jetties of wind that were decreasing the aerodynamics of my carbon fiber bicycle.  Furthermore, I had a bicycle bag underneath my seat that was also sticking out and possibly adding to the drag.  That's when I turned to the XLab's Carbon Wing!

I chose the carbon model because I could afford to and everything else was carbon as it was.  Furthermore, there is minimal wear and tear on these wings so I didn't fear any breakage.  I added on the XLab's gorilla cages for my bottles and I was ready.

The Carbon Wing offers a ton of options for positioning.  I tried one option first and went for a ride.  The bottles were way too far away and sagged too far down.  A couple adjustments and they were touching my butt.  Another slight adjustment and they are perfect!  Not only are the bottles available within arms reach, I do not have to stop cycling and they are behind a huge wind break: ME!

To top it all off, the wing comes with a couple straps to use if you also purchase the pouch.  I did not need the pouch as I just wrapped my CO2 cartridge inside a tube, used a couple rubber bands to hold a $20 bill, my spoons, and a patch, and then stuck the whole thing between the bottles.  The strap with velcro holds it firmly and everything is there when I need it.  To hold gels and whatnot I just use my jersey pockets and don't have a bag dangling down behind my seat creating more drag.

I chose not to buy the CO2 holders and whatnot because I do short triathlons and have no need for two cartridges or multiple tubes.  I just so short rides (less than 50 miles) and take the risk.  I'm glad that the option is there if I so choose.

This is a great purchase and have done away with the old cages on the seat and down tubes."

A TARGET SYSTEM THAT CAN BE USED WITH AIRSOFT GUNS!,"Yes, you can break the chalk targets on this system with an airsoft gun.  I have broken them with a low powered pistol (about 150 FPS) from about 10 feet away.  The targets will only break into large fragments, but they do break.  I have also shot them with my airsoft sniper rifle, which is rated at about 450 FPS, from about 20 yards.  Shots from that will break the targets into smaller fragments.  Shots from my father's Gamo Big Cat will shatter the targets completely, so I imagine using ammo like .22 cal bullets will make these chalk targets explode into a puff of dust.

I've been looking for a destructible airsoft target system for a while now, and this system, along with the Daisy shatterblast targets, are the only ones I have found that work well with both airsoft guns and air guns.  I haven't hit the ferris wheel structure yet, but it does come with extra rods and plastic disc holders for such an event."

They seem to be strong and durable and the swivel mechanism works well.  My only beef is the coloring of the rubber was worn off a bit, just by being shipped in the box bare.  Silly me I would think you'd want the rubber colored all the way through.  It's purely a minor cosmetic thing and ultimately you're hardcore and working out right?  So who really cares so only 1 star deducted.

But really these are good tools and push-ups are a tremendous exercise from just your body weight.  It's one of the reasons the military are so well built."

The fit is excellent and the quick fold down pin allows for easy access into the back hatch.  I bought a 5/8in masterlock hitch pin to secure the bike rack to the receiver(other reviews said the supplied hitch pin was horrible at preventing wobble and suggested drilling out the 1/2in pin hole for a 5/8in pin hole and getting the masterlock...) Once I got the rack installed, I tested the supplied hitch pin and it works just fine.  You do have to ratchet down the lock nut, but I don't think it's going anywhere! I will return the 5/8in masterlock for a 1/2in masterlock and see if it maintains it rigidness. I will admit I've not been able to test it out under load, so look for an update this week.  100% satisfied with the product/fit thus far."
