I've been using RStudio since it was released. I have coded almost exclusively in R, so I personally haven't felt a need to use anything but RStudio. However, I've been picking up Python again, both in preparation for a new position and in recognition of a need to leverage the strengths of multiple programming languages. Using both R and Python has highlighted the need for a tool that can natively handle both.

While VS Code is often referenced as the go-to option, I've been reticent to adapt my data science work to a general code editor, in no small part because I heard rumors that Posit was making the leap to launch a multilingual IDE. And at the end of last month, Positron was quietly revealed, Posit's "next-generation data science IDE." Positron is built on VS Code's open source core, which means I finally need to migrate anyway.

This post is for those who are considering Positron as an alternative to RStudio and VS Code, especially for those who code in both R and Python. As usual, this post is for me. But if you, like me, feel like you're perpetually late to the party, hopefully you'll find this helpful as well as we play catch up together.

## Why use Positron instead of RStudio?

RStudio is great for:

- You're coding primarily in R.
- Even if you're coding in Python, but only secondarily.
- Have a visible Environment/Variable Explorer.
- Built-in File Explorer.

Why use Positron instead of RStudio?

- RStudio is getting dated.
- Coding in Python is only a secondary activity.
- Arguably a better integration with Git/GitHub?
- Get the benefits of VS Code without the bloat.

## Why use Positron instead of VS Code?

VS Code is great for:

- You're coding primarily in Python (or another, non-R language).
- You want to use GitHub Copilot, including its chat feature.
- Great general purpose text editor (light-weight in that sense).
- Remote work options/tunneling?
- Docker integration.
- Everyone else on your team is using it (so, same argument as Python).

Why use Positron instead of VS Code?

- Coding in R isn't great with VS Code.
- Get the benefits of VS Code but with a focus on data science.
- Both R and Python work natively!
- Code execution works the same for both R and Python.
- VS Code is a code editor while Positron is an IDE.
- Has a native Environment/Data Explorer and Plot panel.
- Get the benefit of VS Code extensions (not marketplace though).

What does Positron lack?

It's early days. The public beta just released.

- Still can’t tunnel via SSH to remote servers.
- Still can’t use Github Copilot.
