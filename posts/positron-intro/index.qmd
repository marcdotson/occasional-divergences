## How is Positron more general than RStudio?

- Get the benefit of VS Code extensions (not marketplace though).

## How is Positron more specific than VS Code?

- Both R and Python work natively!
- Code execution works the same for both R and Python.
- Has a native Environment and Plot panel.

## How is Positron just right? Goldilocks/Three Bears.

- Still can’t tunnel via SSH to remote servers.
- Still can’t use Github Copilot.

## Final thoughts
