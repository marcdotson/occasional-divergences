As usual, this post is largely for me. But hopefully others will find it helpful as well. I'm a long-time RStudio user. I code primarily in R, so I haven't seen a need to use anything else. However, over this past year I've been slowly picking up Python again in preparation for a new position. And in so doing, I've been increasingly exposed to VS Code as an option.

At the same time, I heard rumors that Posit was making the leap to a multi-language IDE. (Posit mission statement?) That alone left me reticent to pick up VS Code if I was about to use a new tool anyway. But Positron is built on VS Code's underlying open source core, which means I need to migrate anyway. I'm usually late to the party, so this is playing catch up.

## Why use Positron instead of RStudio?

RStudio is great for:

- You're coding primarily in R.
- Even if you're coding in Python, but only secondarily.
- Have a visible Environment/Variable Explorer.
- Built-in File Explorer.

Why use Positron instead of RStudio?

- RStudio is getting dated.
- Coding in Python is only a secondary activity.
- Get the benefits of VS Code without the bloat.

## Why use Positron instead of VS Code?

VS Code is great for:

- You're coding primarily in Python (or another, non-R language).
- You want to use GitHub Copilot, including its chat feature.
- Arguably a better integration with Git/GitHub?
- Great general purpose text editor (light-weight in that sense).
- Remote work options/tunneling?
- Docker integration.
- Everyone else on your team is using it (so, same argument as Python).

Why use Positron instead of VS Code?

- Coding in R isn't great with VS Code.
- Get the benefits of VS Code but with a focus on data science.
- Both R and Python work natively!
- Code execution works the same for both R and Python.
- VS Code is a code editor while Positron is an IDE.
- Has a native Environment/Data Explorer and Plot panel.
- Get the benefit of VS Code extensions (not marketplace though).

What does Positron lack?

It's early days. The public beta just released.

- Still can’t tunnel via SSH to remote servers.
- Still can’t use Github Copilot.
