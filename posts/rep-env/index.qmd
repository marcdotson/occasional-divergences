Recently in full release at 1.0.0. Implement for R and Python.

[https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html](link)

For *r*eproducible *env*ironment.

- `renv::init()` to create a project library `renv/library` and a lockfile `renv.lock`.
- `renv::snapshot()` to record packages and their sources in the lockfile.
- `renv::restore()` to reinstall the specific package versions recorded in the lockfile.

> You’ll then need to commit renv.lock, .Rprofile, renv/settings.json and renv/activate.R to version control, ensuring that others can recreate your project environment. If you’re using git, this is particularly simple because renv will create a .gitignore for you, and you can just commit all suggested files.

## What are environments?

### Python

Discuss Python study group and use of environments (see https://blog.jeremarc.com/posts/python-env/).

### R

System library where all packages are installed. {renv} makes it easy to create project libraries.

Go over {renv} and its use for Python in the RStudio IDE.
Any helpful discussion of environments in WTF?
