Causal inference defined... I'm a generalist, which is probably a kind way to say that I'm eclectic, interested in many things but not especially good at any one of them. This is probably why I became a journalist and why I eventually got into data analytics. The challenge for someone like me, and maybe for you as well, is that science is broad and different fields have developed different approaches. This is also true for the social sciences. And it's true for data analysis and causal inference. I've found it especially important when you live in an interdisciplinary environment to do the best you can to understand the perspectives of those you speak to, which requires some understanding of their axioms or assumptions that guide their thinking. Philosophy of science -- you can't escape it.

Data Analytics is the perfect place to learn about Causal Inference because itâ€™s become such an interdisciplinary field of its own.

One the domain of econometrics only, causal inference has blossomed into its own field at the intersection of methods from econometrics, epidemiology, and computer science. In this post I try and lay out the fundamental assumptions that differentiate each approach, including which problems they are especially appropriate to use for each.

Is deductive vs. inductive reasoning the same as "estimating effects from known causes" vs. "forming reasonable beliefs about causes from known effects"? Is this related to focusing on avoiding omitted variable bias vs. included variable bias?

Or just Rubin vs. Pearl? Is it because of posturing/arrogance that they appear to ignore each other?

## Econometrics

Traditionally about observational data.

Referred to as "program evaluation" in Wooldridge (2010), with specific reference to policy and its effects.

Economists favor inductive reasoning because of their focus on policy evaluation, in "estimating effects from known causes"? Given a set of assumptions, draw some logical conclusions. But what if you want to evaluate your assumptions? Science needs both deductive and inductive reasoning.

Obsession with OLS because of its properties? Focused on avoiding omitted variable bias but not included variable bias? WHY DON'T ECONOMISTS TAKE PROBABILITY SERIOUSLY?

## Statistics?

Traditionally about sampling and experimentation.

What about Bayes? Where "we can form reasonable beliefs about causes from known effects."

## Epidemiology

## Computer science

## Final thoughts
