Data Analytics is the perfect place to learn about Causal Inference because itâ€™s become such an interdisciplinary field of its own.

One the domain of econometrics only, causal inference has blossomed into its own field at the intersection of methods from econometrics, epidemiology, and computer science. In this post I try and lay out the fundamental assumptions that differentiate each approach, including which problems they are especially appropriate to use for each.

Is deductive vs. inductive reasoning the same as "estimating effects from known causes" vs. "forming reasonable beliefs about causes from known effects"? Is this related to focusing on avoiding omitted variable bias vs. included variable bias?

Or just Rubin vs. Pearl? Is it because of posturing/arrogance that they appear to ignore each other?

## Econometrics

Traditionally about observational data.

Referred to as "program evaluation" in Wooldridge (2010), with specific reference to policy and its effects.

Economists favor inductive reasoning because of their focus on policy evaluation, in "estimating effects from known causes"? Given a set of assumptions, draw some logical conclusions. But what if you want to evaluate your assumptions? Science needs both deductive and inductive reasoning.

Obsession with OLS because of its properties? Focused on avoiding omitted variable bias but not included variable bias? WHY DON'T ECONOMISTS TAKE PROBABILITY SERIOUSLY?

## Statistics?

Traditionally about sampling and experimentation.

What about Bayes? Where "we can form reasonable beliefs about causes from known effects."

## Epidemiology

## Computer science

## Final thoughts
