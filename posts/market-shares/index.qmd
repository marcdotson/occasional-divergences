  Posterior predictions resulting from modeling conjoint experiment data yield a number of informative statistics, though in practice there hasn't been as much concern with making formal causal estimates.

Andrew's post about different kinds of posterior predictions: https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2022/09/26/guide-visualizing-types-posteriors



## Market shares

- Market shares using point estimates.
- Market shares propagating uncertainty from the entire posterior.
- Place of different kind of posterior predictions in market share calculations?

## Causal estimands

What are the posterior predictions for causal inference?
- Use {marginaleffects}?
- Standardization/g-computation, inverse probability weighting, and maximum likelihood estimation.
- Application of causal machine learning?

Can we think about ACMEs as a different way for computing attribute or level importance?

## Final thoughts
