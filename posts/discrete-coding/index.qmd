There are a number of ways to code (i.e., encode) discrete (i.e., categorical) explanatory variables, with different coding strategies suited for specific use cases. In this post, we explore using two of the most common ways to code discrete explanatory variables: dummy coding and index coding. Another common approach is called effects or sum-to-one coding. For a great walkthrough of that approach and its benefits in the context of choice modeling, see Elea Feit's [post](https://eleafeit.com/posts/2021-05-23-parameterization-of-multinomial-logit-models-in-stan/) that helped inspire this one.

Let's start with a simple model and work up to choice models.

## Flat regression

Let's generate flat regression data that includes discrete explanatory variables.

```{stan generate-flat-data, output.var="generate_flat_data", eval=FALSE}
// Index and parameter values.
data {
  int<lower = 1> N;    // Number of observations.
  int<lower = 1> I;    // Number of covariates.
  matrix[N, I] X;      // Matrix of covariates.

  vector[I] beta;      // Vector of slopes.
  real<lower = 0> tau; // Variance of the regression.
}

// Generate data according to the flat regression.
generated quantities {
  // Vector of observations.
  vector[N] y;

  // Generate data.
  for (n in 1:N) {
    y[n] = normal_rng(X[n,] * beta, tau);
  }
}
```

Call `generate_flat_data` from R.

```{r call-generate-flat-data, eval=TRUE}
#| message: false
# Load packages.
library(tidyverse)
library(cmdstanr)
library(posterior)
library(bayesplot)
library(tidybayes)

# Set the simulation seed.
set.seed(42)

# Specify data and parameter values.
sim_values <- list(
  N = 50,                    # Number of observations.
  I = 5,                     # Number of covariates.
  J = c(2, 3),               # Number of levels for each discrete variable.
  beta = c(1, -4, 6, 3, -2), # Vector of slopes.
  tau = 1                    # Variance of the regression.
)

# Matrix of covariates.
sim_X <- matrix(data = 0, nrow = sim_values$N, ncol = (sim_values$I))
for (n in 1:sim_values$N) {
  temp_X <- NULL
  for (j in 1:length(sim_values$J)) {
    temp_J <- rep(0, sim_values$J[j])
    temp_J[sample(seq(1, (sim_values$J[j])), 1)] <- 1
    temp_X <- c(temp_X, temp_J)
  }
  sim_X[n,] <- temp_X
}
sim_values$X <- sim_X

head(sim_values$X)

# Compile the model for generating data.
generate_flat_data <- cmdstan_model(
  stan_file = here::here("posts", "discrete-coding", "Code", "generate_flat_data.stan"),
  dir = here::here("posts", "discrete-coding", "Code", "Compiled")
)

# Generate data.
sim_data <- generate_flat_data$sample(
  data = sim_values,
  chains = 1,
  iter_sampling = 1,
  seed = 42,
  fixed_param = TRUE
)

# Extract generated data.
sim_y <- sim_data$draws(variables = "y", format = "draws_list") %>%
  pluck(1) %>%
  flatten_dbl()

head(sim_y)
```

### Dummy coding

Also known as indicator coding, dummy coding is the most common way to deal with discrete variables, where a single discrete variable with `K` levels is encoded as `K - 1` binary columns, each indicating the presence or absence of the given level. It is an approach to identifying the estimates of discrete explanatory levels that is inherited from frequentist models.

If we include all levels of a single discrete variable, they sum up *across columns* to a constant---to an *intercept*. If we did that with more than one discrete variable, we would have more than one intercept and they would no longer be identified. With dummy coding, it is typical to include an intercept (i.e., a constant, often a column of `1`'s) and drop the first level (i.e., the reference level) of each of the discrete variables.

Here's a flat regression using dummy coding.

```{stan flat-regression-dummy, output.var="flat_regression_dummy", eval=FALSE}
// Index value and observations.
data {
  int<lower = 1> N;    // Number of observations.
  int<lower = 1> I;    // Number of covariates.
  vector[N] y;         // Vector of observations.
  matrix[N, I] X;      // Matrix of covariates.
}

// Parameters.
parameters {
  real alpha;          // Intercept.
  vector[I] beta;      // Vector of slopes.
  real<lower = 0> tau; // Variance of the regression.
}

// Regression.
model {
  // Priors.
  alpha ~ normal(0, 5);
  for (i in 1:I) {
    beta[i] ~ normal(0, 5);
  }
  tau ~ normal(0, 5);

  // Likelihood.
  for (n in 1:N) {
    y[n] ~ normal(alpha + X[n,] * beta, tau);
  }
}
```

Let's call `flat_regression_dummy` from R.

```{r call-flat-regression-dummy, eval=TRUE}
#| message: false
# Specify data.
data <- list(
  N = length(sim_y),    # Number of observations.
  I = ncol(sim_X) - 2,  # Number of covariates.
  y = sim_y,            # Vector of observations.
  X = sim_X[, -c(1, 3)] # Matrix of covariates.
)

# Compile the model.
flat_regression_dummy <- cmdstan_model(
  stan_file = here::here("posts", "discrete-coding", "Code", "flat_regression_dummy.stan"),
  dir = here::here("posts", "discrete-coding", "Code", "Compiled")
)

# Fit the model.
fit_dummy <- flat_regression_dummy$sample(
  data = data,
  chains = 4,
  parallel_chains = 4,
  seed = 42
)
```

Note that we can't directly recover the parameters values we used when simulating the data. Dummy coding is equivalent to specifying each included level as a contrast with the reference level. We can compare the dummy-coded marginal posteriors to the contrasted true parameter values.

```{r flat-contrasts-dummy, eval=FALSE}
# Extract draws and compare contrasts.
contrast_values <- tibble(
  .variable = str_c("contrast", 1:(sim_values$I - length(sim_values$J))),
  values = c(
    # First discrete variable.
    sim_values$beta[2] - sim_values$beta[1],
    # Second discrete variable.
    sim_values$beta[4] - sim_values$beta[3],
    sim_values$beta[5] - sim_values$beta[3]
  )
)
fit_dummy$draws(variables = "beta", format = "draws_df") %>%
  mutate_variables(
    contrast1 = `beta[1]`,
    contrast2 = `beta[2]`,
    contrast3 = `beta[3]`
  ) %>%
  gather_draws(contrast1, contrast2, contrast3) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = .variable, x = .value)) +
  stat_histinterval() +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = values), contrast_values, color = "red") +
  facet_wrap(~ .variable, scales = "free", ncol = 1)
```

The drawback to dummy coding in a Bayesian setting with *real data* is that we need to specify priors over the contrasts rather than the parameters themselves. This complication for setting priors is a good reason to consider effects coding (again, see Elea Feit's [post](https://eleafeit.com/posts/2021-05-23-parameterization-of-multinomial-logit-models-in-stan/) on that topic). Dummy coding also enshrines the reference level as something special, making it non-trivial to compute other contrasts.

### Index coding

Also known as one-hot encoding, index coding similarly turns each level of a discrete variable into its own binary column. However, with index coding we *don't* include an intercept and *don't* include any reference levels.

By not including reference levels, the intercept is implied by the fact that the columns sum to a constant, as discussed previously. But when we have more than one discrete variable we also have more than one implied intercept. This would create an identification problem in a frequentist setting, but in a Bayesian analysis we simply rely on the prior to enable identification of each of the parameters. As a bonus, the contrasts are always identified even if their constituent parameter estimates are not.

Here's a flat regression using index coding. Note that the only difference here is the absence of the intercept `alpha`.

```{stan flat-regression-index, output.var="flat_regression_index", eval=FALSE}
// Index value and observations.
data {
  int<lower = 1> N;    // Number of observations.
  int<lower = 1> I;    // Number of covariates.
  vector[N] y;         // Vector of observations.
  matrix[N, I] X;      // Matrix of covariates.
}

// Parameters.
parameters {
  vector[I] beta;      // Vector of slopes.
  real<lower = 0> tau; // Variance of the regression.
}

// Regression.
model {
  // Priors.
  for (i in 1:I) {
    beta[i] ~ normal(0, 5);
  }
  tau ~ normal(0, 5);

  // Likelihood.
  for (n in 1:N) {
    y[n] ~ normal(X[n,] * beta, tau);
  }
}
```

And we call `flat-regression-index` from R.

```{r call-flat-regression-index, eval=TRUE}
#| message: false
# Specify data.
data <- list(
  N = length(sim_y),   # Number of observations.
  I = ncol(sim_X),     # Number of covariates.
  y = sim_y,           # Vector of observations.
  X = sim_X            # Matrix of covariates.
)

# Compile the model.
flat_regression_index <- cmdstan_model(
  stan_file = here::here("posts", "discrete-coding", "Code", "flat_regression_index.stan"),
  dir = here::here("posts", "discrete-coding", "Code", "Compiled")
)

# Fit the model.
fit_index <- flat_regression_index$sample(
  data = data,
  chains = 4,
  parallel_chains = 4,
  seed = 42
)
```

With index coding we *can* directly recover the parameters values we used when simulating the data! Additionally, it is straightforward to produce whatever contrasts we'd like! Here we re-produce the same plots as before and compare it to the contrasted true parameter values.

```{r flat-contrasts-index, eval=FALSE}
# Extract draws and compare contrasts.
contrast_values <- tibble(
  .variable = str_c("contrast", 1:(sim_values$I - length(sim_values$J))),
  values = c(
    # First discrete variable.
    sim_values$beta[2] - sim_values$beta[1],
    # Second discrete variable.
    sim_values$beta[4] - sim_values$beta[3],
    sim_values$beta[5] - sim_values$beta[3]
  )
)
fit_index$draws(variables = c("beta"), format = "draws_df") %>%
  mutate_variables(
    contrast1 = `beta[2]` - `beta[1]`,
    contrast2 = `beta[4]` - `beta[3]`,
    contrast3 = `beta[5]` - `beta[3]`
  ) %>%
  gather_draws(contrast1, contrast2, contrast3) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = .variable, x = .value)) +
  stat_histinterval() +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = values), contrast_values, color = "red") +
  facet_wrap(~ .variable, scales = "free", ncol = 1)
```

Index coding like this is only possible in a Bayesian framework where the use of priors obviates the necessity of strict identification strategies. However, it's not without costs. We will need to specify informative priors, which we should be doing anyway, and the model itself may take longer to converge.

## Hierarchical multinomial logit

Questions: 

- Specifying a brand intercept (i.e., index coding the brand attribute) in a hierarchical multinomial logit model where an intercept isn't identified.
- Finally, there is a question of using contrasts of marginal posteriors to answer hypotheses and how those contrasts are or are not impacted by the coding used.

And the peculiar case of intercepts and brand intercepts...if intercepts aren't identified, it could be the prior alone that is providing a sensible posterior. To test this, let's use a uniform prior.

It's not just the prior. When we consider choice models, it's the outside good that is at play. The outside good provides a reference to the alternatives, a kind of intercept that is identified in the model even when a traditional intercept is not. We have two things to test here:

- Outside good coded as zero with brand intercepts.
- Outside good coded as a binary attribute (it's own intecept) with dummy coded brands.

These should be equivalent. But what if it's a forced choice and there is no outside option?
