Introduction to the idea of facilitating statistical literacy by beginning with a unifying probabilistic lense that leads into Bayesian inference. Collect resources and links. A teaching philosophy. The beginnings of a pedagogical paper.

Can I compare frequentism to Trinitarian ideas? Not intuitive but hard to let go of once they take root.

-   Reference the \[blog post\](<http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/>) that first inspired this idea.
-   Transfer notes and reference from \[this old issue\](<https://github.com/marcdotson/old-blog/issues/20>) and what I have in Notes.
-   A need to build intuition for non-technical students.
-   The necessity of intuition having a "unifying principle" to build on.
-   Who said that Bayesian inference is what happens when you take probability seriously?
-   How to introduce Bayes without using frequentist language (McElreath).
-   Not treating Bayesian inference as an advanced topic that comes after frequentist inference.

## Bayes is dead. Long live Bayes.

## Frequentism as a special case

Illustrating the difference. Frequentist inference always feels like backing into a problem, but how to illustrate this idea in a way that is intuitive?

| Concepts | Bayesian Inference | Frequentist Inference |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Random variables vs. constants/fixed variables | All unknowns (parameters, missing data, etc.) are random variables, data is fixed | Data is a random variable, parameters are fixed |
| Probability distributions | Posterior distributions | Sampling distributions |
