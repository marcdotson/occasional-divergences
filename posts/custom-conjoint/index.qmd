Intro.

- Just need a regular Qualtrics account.
- Piped-data indicators where design is set up through a web service via SQL.
- "Web service" in survey flow in Qualtrics is what enables the piping from a SQL database.
- The SQL database or (set up using a JSON format).
- Experimental design with lots of version (100+ versions).
- Nothing is randomized within Qualtrics -- that's all done before.

- Start by creating an attribute level grid.
- Generate a full factorial design, sample from it to create a fractional factorial design.
- Including checks for level balance (see public policy survey).
- Design Matrix: Version, alternative, choice task, level for each attribute.
- Pipe in to get the values for each of the attribute levels (including images).
- Design Import: Design matrix formatted in a way to put in the database.
- Import the Design Import file as a table in a SQL database.
- On the web server, create a JSON version of the table using PHP (use Jeff's).
- Then create the "Web service" in survey flow in Qualtrics to map the JSON to the survey flags.
- Can write custom HTML and JavaScript to make the conjoint look better/different.
- Need an SLI key because Qualtrics requires HTTPS.
- Can use AWS but you'll need something to support JSON, PHP, and HTTPS.
