        "It seems like everyone is talking about Quarto. Maybe you've read some blogs or watched a presentation or two, but you still have questions. In an attempt to provide some answers, I've put together and streamlined my notes in a way I hope is useful. This post is largely summarized from material presented in the [Getting Started with Quarto](https://rstudio-conf-2022.github.io/get-started-quarto/) and [From R Markdown to Quarto](https://rstudio-conf-2022.github.io/rmd-to-quarto/) workshops, along with the [Hello Quarto](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/keynotes/collaborate-with-quarto/) keynote, and other talks at [rstudio::conf(2022)](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/talks-and-workshops-from-rstudio-conf-2022/). Other helpful sources are included at the bottom of the post. Most importantly, the [Quarto](https://quarto.org) website has *incredible* documentation.\n",

        "## What is Quarto?\n",
        "\n",
        "CLI. Next generation of R Markdown. Available for use in VS Code, Jupyter, and RStudio.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pandoc and Lua filters. Instead of developing R packages to expand the functionality for R alone, development will happen in terms of new Lua filters so functionality is available across languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "An open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Quarto is a single publishing system that is multi-lingual, meaning it isn't tied specifically to R. If you are familiar with R Markdown, you are probably familiar with this pipeline: When you knit an .rmd file, knitr converts your text and R code into a Markdown file and then uses pandoc to produce whatever output you've specified.\n",
        "\n",
        "![](Figures/rmarkdown.jpg)\n",
        "\n",
        "A .qmd file on the other hand can be composed of text and R, Python, and/or Julia code. Either knitr or jupyter will then convert your text and code into a Markdown file followed by pandoc producing whatever output you've specified. \n",
        "\n",
        "![](Figures/quarto.jpg)\n",
        "\n",
        "Quarto accomplishes this by being fully separate from the R ecosystem. You can even run it from the Terminal, if you want to. While it distances itself from being language-specific in order to set up a bigger tent and provide the benefits of R Markdown to Python and Julia users alike, a move incredibly consistent with the positioning of RStudio-turned-Posit, it does align more directly with pandoc and makes more options available in the backend.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Should I switch from R Markdown to Quarto?\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are an R Markdown power user, there might not be reason to move to Quarto. R Markdown will continue to be supported along with Quarto (in fact, the teams are the same at Posit). However, if you aren't a power user, moving to Quarto is likely the right call.\n",
        "\n",
        "Quarto is not only compute-agnostic for those who are multilingual or work in a multilingual environment, it also natively incorporates much of the functionality and ease-of-use that has been developed in the R Markdown ecosystem. What that means for less-than-power-users is that Quarto has incorporated and streamlined much of what R Markdown has to offer right out-of-the-box, without the need to download a ton of additional specialty packages. In fact, Quarto is now included as part of the RStudio installation.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if you've used R Markdown to create presentations, you've probably used or at least heard of xaringan. It's the most powerful R Markdown tool for creating presentations, and it is incredibly finicky. If you know how to use it, great. If you don't know how to use it, just leapfrog to Quarto and start creating reveal.js presentations immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "This all comes with one big caveat: There is no replacement for flexdashboards in Quarto just yet. It's something that is high on the priority list, but if a big part of your workflow requires the use of flexdashboards, it's not yet the time to make the switch from R Markdown.\n",

A block element needs to share a line by itself. Also, to further illustrate Quarto's adherence to Pandoc, Quarto uses an extended version of Pandoc Markdown rather than R Markdown's more limited Markdown. This includes:\n",

        "\n",
        "Does it matter if we use a centered or non-centered parameterization for a hierarchical multinomial logit model? Yes. Based on HMC model diagnostics and using simulated data typical of a conjoint experiment, the centered parameterization is not sufficient. Additionally, though our primary concern isn't [computational efficiency](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06098.pdf), with both models running for 4000 iterations, the centered parameterization took 12 and a half hours to run while the non-centered parameterization took 5 hours to run.\n",
        "\n",
        "This difference in choice model parameterizations is a concern because the centered parameterization is used almost exclusively in practice. However, since HMC isn't as widespread, the diagnostics accompanying other estimation paradigms might not indicate any problems. This post doesn't go so far as to establish the edge cases of when either parameterization might work best or consider *how* wrong the centered parameterization is. Regardless, given the savings in computation time and the evidence presented using simulated data, the non-centered parameterization should be our default approach in choice modeling.\n",
