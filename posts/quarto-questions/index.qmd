It seems like everyone is talking about Quarto. Maybe you've read some blogs or watched a presentation or two, but you still have questions. In an attempt to provide some answers, I've put together and streamlined my notes in a way I hope is useful. This post is largely summarized from material presented in the [Getting Started with Quarto](https://rstudio-conf-2022.github.io/get-started-quarto/) and [From R Markdown to Quarto](https://rstudio-conf-2022.github.io/rmd-to-quarto/) workshops (where the super helpful hand-drawn illustrations come from), along with the [Hello Quarto](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/keynotes/collaborate-with-quarto/) keynote, and other talks at [rstudio::conf(2022)](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/talks-and-workshops-from-rstudio-conf-2022/). Other helpful sources are included at the bottom of the post. Most importantly, the [Quarto](https://quarto.org) website has *incredible* documentation.

But, if all of that feels like a *lot*, hopefully this can help ease you into things. This post is organized by the following questions and my best attempts to provide answers.

- What is Quarto?
- Should I switch from R Markdown to Quarto?
- How do I get started using Quarto?
- What are the benefits of using Quarto for _____?

## What is Quarto?

![](Figures/example-quarto.png)

A quarto is a book size that results from folding each printed sheet into four leaves. (The picture above is actually half an octavo, but the illustration still serves.) It's a real word. It means something. But we're giving it a new definition:

> Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc.

Instead of writing a report or presentation in Word, PowerPoint, etc.; then running code in an R script; then saving output and visualizations; and then pasting them in the report or the presentation -- we can do it all in Quarto, a free system especially tailored to scientific and technical publishing. Pandoc is what makes it possible to take a single Quarto document and produce a report, presentation, website, etc.

For those in the know, Quarto is the next generation of R Markdown. However, instead of being tied to R, Quarto is multilingual, used with R, Python, Julia, and Observable from RStudio, VS Code, and Jupyter. To make it available across all of these languages, it accesses Pandoc via the command-line interface. It also makes use of Lua filters, which are extensions to Pandoc. That means instead of developing R packages to expand the functionality for R alone, development will happen in terms of Lua filters so functionality is available across languages.

If you are familiar with R Markdown, you are probably familiar with this pipeline: When you knit an `.rmd` file, knitr converts your text and R code into a Markdown file and then uses Pandoc to produce whatever output you've specified.

![](Figures/rmarkdown.jpg)

A `.qmd` file on the other hand can be composed of text and R, Python, and/or Julia code. Either knitr or jupyter will then render your text and code into a Markdown file followed by Pandoc producing whatever output you've specified. 

![](Figures/quarto.jpg)

Quarto accomplishes this by being fully separate from the R ecosystem. You can even run it from the shell/terminal, if you want to. While it distances itself from being language-specific in order to set up a bigger tent and provide the benefits of R Markdown to Python and Julia users alike, a move consistent with the positioning of RStudio-turned-Posit, it does align more directly with Pandoc and makes more options available in the back-end.

## Should I switch from R Markdown to Quarto?

If you have a release of RStudio from at least the summer of 2022, you already have Quarto installed. But should you switch from using R Markdown? If you are an R Markdown power user, there might not be reason to move to Quarto. R Markdown will continue to be supported along with Quarto (in fact, the teams are the same at Posit). However, if you aren't a power user, moving to Quarto is likely the right call.

Quarto is not only compute-agnostic for those who are multilingual or work in a multilingual environment, it also natively incorporates much of the functionality and ease-of-use that has been developed in the R Markdown ecosystem. What that means for less-than-power-users is that Quarto has incorporated and streamlined much of what R Markdown has to offer right out-of-the-box, without the need to download a ton of additional specialty packages. In fact, Quarto is now included as part of the RStudio installation.

For example, if you've used R Markdown to create presentations, you've probably used or at least heard of xaringan. It's the most powerful R Markdown tool for creating presentations, and it can be incredibly finicky. If you know how to use it, great. If you don't know how to use it, just leapfrog to Quarto and start creating revealjs presentations immediately.

This all comes with one big caveat: There is no replacement for flexdashboards in Quarto just yet. It's something that is high on the priority list, but if a big part of your workflow requires the use of flexdashboards, it's not yet the time to make the switch from R Markdown.

## How do I get started using Quarto?

It's helpful to consider the basic structure or *grammar*, if you will, of a document. For any given Quarto document, you'll have:

- Content (text, figures, tables, diagrams, etc.)
- Code and output
- Metadata (format, appearance, etc.)

The [Quarto Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) under Authoring has everything you need to get started, beginning with some [Markdown Basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#overview). Markdown is an incredibly simple and human-readable formatting syntax, and Quarto takes advantage of Pandoc Markdown so it has even more features than R Markdown. RStudio also includes a Visual Editor as well so you can create your document using Word-like functionality and have it write your Markdown for you, though it can be a bit buggy switching between the Visual and Source Editors.

### Divs and Spans

One of the more powerful, but possibly confusing, additions is the introduction of Divs and Spans.

> Divs and Spans are generic HTML/CSS elements that are used to format a document. Divs are used for block-level formatting while Spans are used for in-line formatting.

Let's start with a Div (or *Fenced* Div) for formatting block elements.

![](Figures/fenced-div.jpg)

This is incredibly useful if you want to format an entire block of content, such as a paragraph. For example, using the `.callout-warning` class, I can quickly make this:

:::{.callout-warning}
Pay attention to this information!
:::

Spans (or *Bracketed* Spans) work similarly, but are used to format in-line elements.

![](Figures/bracketed-span.jpg)

Not all output formats support all classes of Divs and Spans, but including Divs and Spans provides a *consistent* way to format blocks and in-line content and represents one of the many benefits of Quarto aligning closely with Pandoc.

### YAML

At the top of each document is a header where most of the metadata lives. Think of it as global formatting or settings for the entire document. This is written in *another* language called Yet Another **Markup** Language (i.e., YAML). It looks like this:

```
---
title: "Untitled"
format: revealjs
---
```

Like Markdown, it is incredibly simple and designed to be human-readable. It follows a `key: value` syntax. The header can include lots of different items, but perhaps the most is the `format` that, when you render a document, will tell Pandoc what type of document to create. Note that this is a change for R Markdwon where `format` was `output`. There are a number of changes like that, all part of making Quarto align more with Pandoc and better serve as a multilingual publishing tool. As a bonus, there is now YAML auto-completion with Quarto installed.

### Code Cells

Besides content like text, figures, etc., the real magic of using Quarto is including code and its output as part of the same document. Code cells are included using syntax that looks very similar to a Div.

```{{r}}
#| echo: fenced
transcripts <- read_rds(here::here("Data", "transcripts.rds")) |> 
  tibble() |> 
  separate(doc_id, into = c("gvkey", "call_date", "title"), sep = "_")
```

The code cell is fenced with the language in braces, but instead of attributes in the braces, or the old R Markdown code chunk options, Quarto code cells use the new hashpipe operator `#|` where the options follow YAML notation. This allows for two things. First, the same YAML options can be used for languages other than R. Second, if there are code cell options that you want to apply to the entire document, you can just move them into the header:

```
---
title: "Untitled"
format: revealjs
execute:
  echo: false
---
```

## What are the benefits of using Quarto for _____?

It's worth repeating, but as the next generation of R Markdown, Quarto incorporates a lot of the benefits of the R Markdown ecosystem into its base installation. There is far too much to repeat here, and I'm not trying to recreate the [Quarto](https://quarto.org) documentation, but I'd like to highlight a few things that I've found especially useful or interesting so far.

### Documents

- Parameterized documents with data and variables included in the header under the `params` key and saved as a list with named elements that can be referenced within the document.
- Cache computationally intensive code with `#| cache: true` so it is re-rendered when the document is rendered again.
- Freeze computationally intensive code with `#| freeze: auto` so that it only re-renders when the source file changes.
- Use `#| code-fold: true` in HTML documents to hide the code but have it accessible to be folded out if needed.
- Use `#| code-link: true` in HTML documents to link the functions back to their online documentation (only in knitr currently).

### Presentations

- revealjs as a replacement for xaringan.
- The RStudio Visual Editor works with revealjs.
- Code animations and code highlighting.
- Auto animation?!
- Chalkboard.
- PDF export.
- Multiplex.

### Websites

- Start a website (like this [blog](https://occasionaldivergences.com)) with a Quarto project.
- Functionality included in a global YAML.
- Create a new post by creating a new folder and `.qmd`.
- Includes search automatically.

## Final thoughts

Making a multilingual publishing system requires relying more heavily on a set of additional languages that go-between: Markdown, YAML, Pandoc.

- What functionality can I add to slides by moving to Quarto/revealjs? Can I just leapfrog xaringan to revealjs?
- Can Quarto replicate my blog in a way that's simpler to manage?
- Can Quarto replicate what's included in my RA training instructions and paper template? Does it make it easier or is too early in development?

- When will we have a flexdashboard equivalent for Quarto? Quarto plus Shiny UI? Dashboard builder? Instead of flexdashboard?
- Do we still have to render a Quarto document in the same folder as the associated project file? Or is this just a function of the fact that "Quarto documents reference from their existing folder/directory"? Can we use `here::here()` instead?
- Render on save?
- Does Quarto handle tex styles? Does it create the .bib file automatically?

Besides the [rstudio::conf(2022)](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/talks-and-workshops-from-rstudio-conf-2022/) workshops and keynote in addition to the [Quarto](https://quarto.org) documentation itself, here are a number of additional sources that I've found useful.
