Jeff started it. He didn't know what Bayesian inference was, but he was interested in learning. Naturally he shared his excitement with his little brother, Marc, who (as usual) followed in his footsteps. Now they share that interest working together at the intersection of marketing and data science and, occasionally, writing on this blog.
